 Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again: bath time.  Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way,  or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way...  So that's how you wanna play it, huh?
 Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch!  Huh? "New" Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm.
  Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath!...  ...Please...  ... I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages.
 Yup, and just relax.
 Oooh! Oooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?
 A flower.
 They sure do.
 Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?
 Yeah.
 That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest.
 I thought that meant you were nuts.
  Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby, and if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength!  What do you think about that, "Miss Mittens"?
 Ahh!  Hey, no fair, Sandy! You got a head start!
 Hey!  You did that on purpose!
  Aaaaah!
  I didn't!
  I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!
 I can underwater! I'm...  Hydrodynamically designed!  Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?
 I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there!  -halfway there!-halfway there!.
  There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature  waiting!
 I did! And I took a head start like you did!
 I guess I don't, air breather!
 Tree climber!
 Kite flier!
  Take that back! You-  not wet person!
 Proves what?
 ManSponge...
 Oh my gosh, Patrick. This is the greatest wall of superhero super gadgetry ever! I'm going to play with the Cosmic-Ray!
 What about the Orb of Confusion?
 Come Boy Patrick. While our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay.
 What is it, trusted sidekick?
 Looks like he's frozen or something.
 It appears to be some sort of prison chamber...  ...made out of frozen tartar sauce. This is incredible. Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil Man Ray is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him.  Pat, what are you doing? We're not supposed to touch anything!
 We could get in trouble.
 He said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain!
 Uh, actually, Mr. uh... Man Ray, sir, only your head is free.
 Well, uhh, Mr. Evil Man Ray, sir, we can't do that.
 Because you're evil!
 Yeah, sure, why not?
 Really?
 Really, really?
 Really, really, really?
 Well, that's good enough for me.
 Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode #17.
 Oh, me too, me too.
 Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle...
 We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go.
 Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready first day at goodness school?  Pat, get your wallet out.  Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet.  Now, what do you do?
 No. Wrong.  Good people don't rip other people's arms off  Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggling with a heavy package. What do you do?
 Alright, goodness lesson number three.  Uhh, let's see.
 Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good.
 Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad.
 No, you let go!
 Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word.
 No. Please.
 Rehabilitated.
 It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future.  Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness.  Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff.  We're not supposed to touch that, either.  We are really not suppose to touch those, sir.  Good people have no use for weapons such as...  thoooose!
 That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat.
 Forget about your skin, Patrick. Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him. This is a job for Mermaid Man...
 To the Invisible Boatmobile!
 Wait! I don't have a license.
 You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle Boy.
 Not so fast, arch-villain. We still have the Orb of Confusion.  Take this!  Doy. Duh.
  I am raking the leaves.
 Sandy, I can't rake any faster.  These are big leaves.  And they keep breaking into more leaves.
 What's the big rush anyway, Sandy?
 Hibernating? What's that?
 Can I do that?
 Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male.
 Why, Sandy? When does your... "carburation" begin?
 But Sandy, that only gives us 1, 2, 3...  168 more hours of playtime!
 Climb!
 Jump!
 Ride!
 Wait, Sandy!
 Sandy?
 Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice any of my time that I haven't already sold to Mr. Krabs to you.
 Life's as extreme as you want to make it!  Whoo!
 Yeah.  Whew, what a workout.  I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow.  Ow.
 Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again.  Good night, Gary.
  W-what h-happened to s-sleeping?
 Yeah! I've never played extreme jacks before!
 Sandy, are you sure we're supposed to be standing up here?
 Gee, that sounds safe! I mean, fun.  Okay, I'm ready! I thought you said we were riding through the park, Sandy!
  This squirrel's trying to kill me! Any more of these stunts and I'll be reduced to a puddle!  Wait a minute, I've got to talk my way out of this! Sandy, I think I need to tell you something.
 Well, it's just that I'm feeling sort of...  I just feel like maybe I need to...
 Not yet.
 You do that.
 Gotta hide! Uh-G-Gotta hide!  Home? No. Gary can't keep a secret.  Under a rock? It's so original!
 Eww.  What's happening to me?
  I'm off to work at the Krusty Krab, frying up patties and bladdity blab!  Huh? That's new. Strange place to park a car. What’s this for?
 Carbon dioxide?
 Why do you want an endless summer, Mr. Krabs?
 Here are the colorful boats that travel the canals in Xochimilco.
 No, Patrick, I said, "Xochimilco," not...  We learned that in Mexico, instead of Halloween, they celebrate día de los Muertos.
 Uh, but, Patrick, you are Patrick.
 I think not. You, sir are Orin J. Ruffy.
 Huh.
 Hi, Patrick, what are you reading?
 Hey, Patrick?
 Hey everybody! It's time to dance!
 Do the cyclops!
 Now, do the sea monster!
 Patrick, are you okay?
 Jellyfishing Safety Tips. Rule number one: never to feed the jellyfish while jellyfishing.
 Rule number two: never, ever try to capture a baby jellyfish.
  Which leads us to our final rule, always carry a thick tube of emergency Jellyfishing Sting Ointment.
  Patrick, with this time machine we can go back to the past and make our young selves wiser.
 Well, Patrick, I'm glad you asked that question.  ♪I would give free Krabby Patties, to the whoole darn town.♪
 ♪And if I saw a frown, "Aha!" I'd turn it upside down!♪  ♪And as for toxic waste, I don't care for the taste.♪
  ♪So listen to my skeem. I'd change it into ice creeeam!♪
 And that's what I would do. What would you do, Patrick?
 The Story of  King Neptune.  When King Neptune was a little Neptune, his mother sent him adrift in a river. As he floated along, a giant meteor fell on Earth. An alien appeared, and inflicted the baby with Super Neptune Fluid.  By the time he was in school, he had already begun exhibiting signs of super-duperness. As an adult, he would fly through the sea, helping people, and getting snails off of sea-trees.
 Sure.
 Gadzooks!!!
 Help me pick out an outfit for the party, Gary Bear.
 Too much, huh?
 Too little? Yeah, little bit drafty, too.
 Oh, Gary. You are a real stickler for authenticity.  Ta-dah!
 You're right, Gary. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
  Oh, hello. Welcome to the Bikini Bottom Jellyfish Trauma Center. Let's go inside.  Ow!
  These poor souls are here because they found themselves for the wrong side of a jellyfish stinger. Not if they're the right side.  The point is, that we will all be respectful...
 Bah! Stepped on a pickle.
 Ow, that pickle's Plankton. What happened to you?
 Aw, you poor thing, have some flowers.
 Nurse! This hot dog needs help!
 Patrick, what are you doing here?
 I think we've all learned something here for today. Thanks for watching.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 I almost forgot. It's "Surprise Sandy Day."  The only question is how to surprise her.
 I know who took your money.
  It was me, Mr. Krabs! Please don't tear me into a thousand little pieces and mesh me back together and tear me to pieces again!
 To clean and polish it.
  Morning!
 SpongeBob SquarePants at your service, for I am an honorary crossing guard.
 You're safe with me.
 We'll see about that!
 You're wel...  welcome.
  At first, we didn't know what to do with all the money.
  Ahh! The wonders of modern-day technology!  What astonishing and distractionable adventures will you lead me on today! Okay SpongeBob, you've got to figure out about the times! You have got to figure out...  Snapper Chat!
 Umm...  I guess I'll take a picture of this...  ...now!
 Twelve bubbles blowing!
 Are you okay, Gary?
 What we gonna do?
 Whoops.  Sorry, Bubble Bass.
 Okay, Patrick, up with the loveseat.
 But don't you have to pack your things before we can move 'em?
 Oh, Patrick
 Okay, Patrick, let's get p-p-p-packing!
 Oh...
 Whew, I hope we didn't leave anything behind.
 Oh pardon us, ma'am, but could you walk around?
 Back it up?  Okay. Back it up, Patrick.
 Oh, oh, oh!
 Phew, hey, Patrick, from now on, we gotta be more careful. Huh? Patrick...
 Oh, focus, Patrick, focus!
 Ah, that's perfect.
 I'm down here.
 We shall, Patrick
 Hmm...Hm?  Hey, this is the address! We made it, Patrick! Nice aim, babies!
 Focus! Let's get all this stuff inside the house, then we can eat. Hmm, hmm.
 Oh, Bubble Bass, special delivery.  Hmm? Okay, Patrick, push it!
 Uh-oh, Patrick. Look what we did to Bubble Bass's granny's house.
 Well, that's a relief. For a minute there, I thought we did something wrong.
 Don't look down, Patrick!
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh!  Uh-oh, Patrick, I think I have the—   Hiccups.
 Here comes another one, Patrick.
 Thanks, buddy. We're almost there. Just a few more steps, and we'll claim that free lunch.
 Well, this is a dilly of a pickle.
 Oh, your goods are all good, Bubble Bass. And we sure build up an appetite for that free lunch.
 That was the meanest thing I ever saw, Bubble Bass. You, sir, have crossed the line of aquatic decency. You might think you took a couple of bottom feeders like us for a ride today, but I got a newsflash for you, slappy. These bottom feeders wouldn't eat your free lunch if you paid us.
 Come, Patrick. I'll make you a free Krabby Patty for $2.50 plus tax.
 Founders Day is here today, Squidward is this even?
  Wow, Mr. Krabs really loves Founder's Day!
 But just look at him go!
 Well it's not just that, Mr. Krabs has a lot of love in his heart for this town.
 Hey at least we have Founders Day!
 Tummies! Ha-ha-ha
  Ready for work!  Good morning, Squidward, I...   Not ready for work!
  Thanks for waiting, Squidward.
  I was in such a hurry, I almost forgot my pants.
 I guess I was in a panic, I mean I can't believe we're running so late for work, and you, huh, Squidward, can you believe it, are you panicking too? Late for work, late for work, we're running late for work, right?
 I know, only fifteen minutes early? Maybe we should take a shortcut!  Squidward, what are you doing?!
 I don't follow.
 Speak English, brainiac!
  Mmm, strawberry!
 Sorry, Squidward. I just never seen a séance before.
 Just leave it to me, old rusty one! Prepare for a... What the barnacles is a Rusty on Rye?  Let's see... R... R... R... Ramblin Ham, Red Herring, Rib Tickler, Rusty Penguin, Salty Steamer. Huh, guess I don't know how to make Rusty on Rye.  But I can certainly learn! Help me out, sir. Can you clue me in on what was on your beloved Rusty on Rye?
  No!  Mr. Krabs! There was an unsatisfied customer! Why don't we serve the Rusty on Rye anymore?
 Ooh.
 I believe I've seen a program on this matter!
 I may be able to get that recipe after all. I just need to call in a favor.  Hi Patrick! SpongeBob here.  Yeah, the one with square pants. Mm-hmm. Hey, listen, can you meet me after work? I need your help with something.  Your best friend SpongeBob SquarePants.
  I got it.
  Nothing.
  Going to work, going to work, I'm going to work! I'm going to work, I'm going to work  I'm going to work!  I'm going to work. I'm going to work, going to work, go-going to work. I'm crossing the street!  I'm crossing the street! Cross- whup!  I'd recognize that sound anywhere! It's the sound of horrible, croaking sobbing!
 Plankton?
 Plankton, what's got you so upset? I can hear you from three blocks away!
 Doomsday device? What's it supposed to do?
 So, what does it do instead?
 Sparks and falls apart?
  N-no!  I believe you! I uh...  ...believe you.
 Well, look on the bright side, Plankton. If all your hopes and dreams finally came true, then you wouldn't have anything left to look forward to.
 Plankton, wait! Wait! Wait!
 Maybe what you need is to join a club or something. Meet new people. You know, make some friends.
 Um, something like that.
 Well, usually when I'm trying to find something, I just look it up in the phone book. 
 Man Ray? But he's one of Bikini Bottom's most notorious super villains! Arch nemesis of fame television super heroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.  He's in the phone book?  Plankton, you were looking under  not 
  Mr. Krabs! You said to hold onto your glasses! When all I could find were these extra large milkshake cups!  Do these count?
 Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Emergency Search Light? What for?
 Aye aye, captain! 
  Where is it? Where is it? That search light could be anywhere up here! Oop! There!  Yes! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy will be here in no time!  Hmm. I guess this is only good for nighttime emergencies.  HELP! HELP! Must-find-Mermaid-Man-Barnacle-Boy! Man-Ray-Krusty-Krab-taking-over! 
 A little more sand. Pat, Pat, Pat. Pat, Pat, Patrick! Check it out. An exact replica of the Krusty Krab. One sandy patty. Extra grit.
 ♪Mop, mop, mop, mop, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping mopping!♪
 Sure thing.
  Perfection.
 But, Mr. Krabs I...
 Really?
 Yes, I had a cup of sea kelp and a Neptune muffin.
 I did go to bed 2 minutes later than usual.
 An insomni-wha?
 Oh, but sir, I can't miss work at the Krusty Krab.
 No Krusty Krab?
  Yes, sir.
 I just don't get it Gary, I don't usually have a problem sleeping, do I?
 Well I am not going to allow a mistake like today's to happen again. I am going straight to bed! [Cut to SpongeBob's bed.
 This pillow is hard as a rock! What to do?
 You're right Gary! Warm milk puts me right to sleep! Now, that should do the trick!
  Boy, it sure is quiet around here. Only 5 hours until I go to work. C'mon SpongeBob, you can do this. 4 hours 59 minutes 50 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 45 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 41 seconds!  What if I don't get to sleep at all?  Ohhh, Mr. Krabs was right!  I am an insomniac. What am I gonna do? (speaking) I need some help.  Patrick, Patrick, wake up.
 Oh, yuck! Never mind that Patrick! I need your help! Desperately! I'm a insomniac! I need to sleep!
 Oh boy! A bedtime story!
 Ah, yay!
 Mm, sounds like me.
 Slumber!
 Aw, thank you Sir Cecil.
 Patrick, what are you doing? And what kind of a bedtime story was that, anyway?
 Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep.
 Um, Patrick, that's...
 Patrick, this isn't...
 That's a catchy bit...
 That's an excellent number, but...
  Patrick! This isn't helping either!
 Oh, barnacles.
 Patrick, get serious please!
 I really appreciate your efforts, but I gotta try something else, buddy. 'Kay?
 Blech!
 Okay... Patrick, How is this gonna-
 Hey, That wasn't too bad. What was it?
 C-C-C-C-C-Coffee? Oh, for the last time, Patrick, I'm trying to !
 Uh oh.. feeling jittery, heart p-p-pounding, teeth grinding...  Uh oh.  N-no! No stop! We gotta get to sleep. Well, I guess I'll just have to let my legs tire out and catch up with my weary brain.
 Ahh! Sea troll! Huh? Just a shrub. Keep going till you crash SpongeBob.
 I'm sorry Mr. warm milk, you just tasted so good.  Shoo! That billboard is definitely not talking to you.
 Uhh, Patrick gobbles down the patties. Nom nom nom nom nom.
 Well, cause you're the mascot.
 Oh, I know! Win a date with Squidward Tuesday!
 Mr. Krabs doesn't think my ideas are helping.
 I just want to help him find the perfect Krabby Patty gimmic.
 Great idea, Squidward!
  Ohh, what is this?
 Uhh, I can explain. That partially eaten Krabby Patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art. It's worth a fortune.
 So you see why Mr. Krabs is trying to get it back.
 Plankton, you've stolen a priceless work of art. There's only one thing you can do.
 No, you need to turn yourself in.
 Who's that?
 What?
 Really?
 Now you've gone too far!
 I can't believe you're calling me that!
 Patrick, what are you eating?
 Now Patrick is harboring stolen merchandise in his belly!
  Mr. Krabs, I think I have the solution.
 My pleasure, sir. And I think Patrick likes it too.
  Boy, I can't wait to show Sandy my new karate moves,  oh, Sandy, aaah...  Sandy is in trouble. Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming to save you!
 Whoa...what was that stench?
  You know kah-ra-tay?
 But, Sandy, you already have a black belt.
 Gee...I wish I had a karate belt
 Okay? How do I do that?
 Hm?
 Um...sorry. I'm confused.
 But how can anyone ever truly know whether he or she is worthy?
 To see her vacation slides for the hu..  Ow!
  You called Mr. Krabs?
  Yes! Please!
 The Krusty Krab is stowed and ready to slumber.
 Push-a-what?
 Uh, I'm not following you.
 Oh, you mean your obsession.
 Spring cleaning! Guess what time of year it is, Gary?
 Thanks for your help, Gare!
 Hi, Patrick. How's your spring cleaning going?
 Hey, buddy, what are you cleaning for?
 Who's that?
 Wow, I didn't know you had a sister!
 Gee, I'm sorry, Patrick.
 It's gonna be okay... you're gonna see her again... today... right... today? Come on... cheer up, buddy. Hey, I'll make sure her visit here will be extra super special, no matter what!
 Yeah, Patrick and I go back a long way.  Yeah long way, heh heh, go back.
 No, no, don't be upset with Squidward. He doesn't mean it, don't you, Squidward?
  Oh, Squidward, you jokester.
 Easy now, gents, let's not let tempers flare. Now don't you think, Patrick, it's a teensie bit unfair that sister Sam dismantled Squidward's house?
 It's not like that at all, Patrick. I was just-
 Squidward... wait, Squidward, w-wait! Before you do anything too rash, let me try to talk to them.
 I don't think you should do that.
 Now, Sam, it's not what it seems. Squidward was just rearranging the spiffy.
 Please don't.
 Well, Squidward, at least on the bright side it will motivate you to finally take care of that kitchen remodeled. Right, Squidward?  Huh? Must be getting started.
  Squidward, Squidward stop!  Just calm down, buddy. Let's ease that tentacle off of the accelerator, hmmm?
 Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control.
 She destroyed my house in a fit of rage! She needs to control her temper!
 Patrick?
 Hit it one more time Patrick. Don't want anyone stealing it.  Perfect
 Good Job Patrick.
 We were just posting Patrick's new "For Rent" sign. Did we work on it all morning, see?
  No, Patrick here is just gonna rent out his front yard.
 Oh Squidward, that reminds me. Patrick and I are off to Jellyfish Fields for the day. We were wondering if maybe you can stick around and keep an eye out for any takers.
 Oh, thanks!
 Aww, why not?
 Oh, well thanks anyway, Squidward.
 Do you know what that means?
 Great idea.
 Yeah. Our new neighbor must be really shy.
 Yeah, besides, we have more pressing things to attend to—like this jellyfish we've befriended and this brand new bottle of bubbles!
 Yeah.
  Ooh...delicious!
 With pleasure, Mr. Krabs.  I love this part of the job.
 And this part ain't bad either!
  You don't mean...
  Thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you. It is both an honor and a privilege that I shall---
 As I don the ceremonial white gloves, I can continue the eternal cycle and now deem the Krusty Krab...open.  Patrons, spring forth.  The Krusty Krab will now seat you.
  No need to shout Mr. Krabs, he's right here, secretly watching his favorite soap, "As The Tide Turns."
 You want me to go undercover?
 Understood, Mr. Krabs.  How do you like my new armpit spy cam, huh? Huh?
 Oh, and check this out—a special spy pen! Looks just like a regular pen, right? See? See? See? See? See? See? Just a pen, right? See?
 Well, you'd be mistaken, sir, because this pen is also...a pencil. Hmm? Pretty sweet undercover spy stuff, huh, Mr. Krabs?
 You're right, sir. Who needs a spy pen when you are a master in the undercover arts? I blend in with the common man. Then, like a whisper, I am gone.  Yellow Scrubber to Big Red. Come in, Big Red.
 I am inside. I repeat, I am inside. Nothing of interest to report so far. In fact, it's kind of dumpy. And customer safety... a little lax.  And it smells in here like a tuna bathed in algae after running a marathon.
 I have infiltrated the line right now, and I'll report back once I obtained sample.
 One of your finest sandwiches, please.
  "Headbands equal no service." Barnacles! My disguise's only weakness-  Whoa! Mayday, Big Red. Contact has not been established. Mission abort. Mission abort!  Yellow Scrubber to Big Red, I was not able to obtain any intel.
 Other than the faux dilapidation, not really.
 No. Great Barrier Reef!
 I see a huge statue depicting Mr. Sea Chicken and all his glory!
  I do.
 Guess.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 Correct.
 Word.
 Anything for the artiste.
 Isn't it? I can't believe no one was using it.
 I'm gonna be Squidward's assistant giant rock fetcher!
 Reporting for duty, sir!
 I read you loud and clear, captain. Loud and clear.  Wow, this is heavy.
 Mr. Krabs, if I may be allowed to float an idea.
 I think you look really good, sir. You're golden!
  HIYA! HIYA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! YA! Ta-daa! A gift, in your likeness.
 ‘Cause you're so sweet... Get it?! ‘Cause pineapples are sweet, and you are sweet also as well. Get it?!
 Ahhh. Patrick, Thank you so much! If it weren't for your tremendous gorilla strength, I would've been a goner! If there's anything I can do to return the favor, anything at all... you just let me know. Anyway, back to my Karate exercises.  Oh, and help yourself to the cheese bucket. Thanks again, buddy. HIYA!
  What, what, you mean karate?
 Oh, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick... my dear, dear friend. Karate is a delicate art, a skill that takes years to...
 Yeah... However...
 Well, I did say that, Patrick, but, well, karate is about finesse, not so much brute strength. You see, there's so much you don't know. You have not even scratched the surface of the surface.
 As you wish, just remember one thing. With power, comes responsibility.
 Okay. Let’s start off simple. This is a basic move called "the inverted whirlpool".
 Think you can handle that?
 Now, this is very easy, watch closely.  Haa-haah. You got it?
 Patrick, I didn't want to have to say this... but you're... you're unteachable.
  Look what you did to this wall of cinder blocks. In all my years of training, I've never seen a perfect slice. No ones ever been able to execute such a clean karate chop through a wall of cinder!
 You're a natural! A karate genius!
  Now let's put your new skills to the test. This is sharpened, tempered steel. Now don't be frustrated if it takes a few tri- . Wow. Amazing!
 This is an abandoned, broad-ironed steamboat, solid as a rock. Think you got what it takes?
 Ahhh... better luck next time.
  Noooooo! What did I tell you?!
 Not that!  ...this. : With power... comes responsibility. That means no chopping of any life from or their property. You understand?
 Good!  Oh man, I'm late for work.  See you later, buddy. Don't forget what I said.
 Hey, look, it's Patrick!
 What are you doing...
  Dear Neptune!
 Patrick, don't you think you're taking your perfect slice a bit too far?
 But, but, but-

 SpongeBob.
  I'm sorry, Gary. I thought you were done....  Wow. This town is sure going downhill.  Uh, Mr. Krabs. What are you doing out here?
 I don't know, but when he does that he usually finds change.
 Yeah. Watch.
 You mean snail.
 You said pets were not nothing but disease-carrying vermins that should never be brought to the workplace.
 But the whole process causes Gary big discomfort. I could never do it to him.

 No! No! Patrick! No one is ever going to find us out here!
 Look, Patrick! We made it! Hey best friend? Check this out!  It's a small plastic disc that you throw!
 I do, too, buddy. If only small plastic disc that you throw had a shorter, catchier name.
 Perfect! Now run along, Patrick, and I'll  toss it to you!
 Ready?!
 Nonsense, Patrick. There are plenty of fun things to do in the sand. We can draw, or practice our cursive writing, or...
 I know, we can make sand castles!
 No one's ever been annoyed by a sand castle.  Nothing quite like the joy of sand castling, eh, buddy?  How ya doing over there?
 Oh, a structure like that can't protect a king and his subjects. Here, let me help you. First, you should start all over.
 I'm just trying to help, buddy!
 Well, I suppose I should just tend to the affairs of my own realm.  And I'll start by making a queen to rule by your side.
 All right, Patrick, have it your way.  "You keep to your territory and I'll keep to mine.
  I better build a wall just in case King Pinky gets any funny ideas.  Oh, sir, you built onto my side.
  So, you don't do that!  There! That restores the integrity of our shared border.
 But what for what!?
 Okay, Patrick, I can accept that. No more destruction from this point forward, okay? Okay, back to square one again.  I hereby propose a non-aggression treaty to end hostilities between our two kingdoms.  Patrick, by signing this historic armistice you have brought peace to our lands. May your kingdom prosper! Well that went well!"  What are you doing!? What about the treaty!?
 Oh, is that so!?" Well, if you think you can take down this castle, my answer is bring it on!  Patrick, I'm trying to be the nice guy here, okay? Let's call this silly business off.
 Fine! Have it your way.
 Come on!  How do you like them apples
  Uh huh... mmm hmm. Well put, general! We'll create a surprise military diversion and break through enemy lines. What say you?  Yes! We'll ready ourselves immediately!  How do you like me now?
  Patrick... Patrick! Are you okay!?
  All is fair in love and war my friend slash enemy, or should I say, my friend-enemy!?  Now let's have some real fun!
  Jumping jellyfish! WHOA!
  Ohhhh.
 I'll tell you what happened, Patrick... I got carried away.
 No, no, it wasn't. What started out as a fun dream turned into a horrible, brutal, nightmare. As the winds of time changed the silvery sands of these dunes to a new landscape, so let us hope that our own winds of change will change our spiritual dunes to a landscape of peace. Oh buddy, let's never forget this lesson.
 Oh yeah? I bet you can't!
 No, I can!
 I can!
 Okay, Patrick! Here I come!
 Patrick, maybe we should play something that involves less thinking.
 Hey! Maybe we can play a game with this ball that was buried under here!
 Well, who knows how long it ... Ah! Mother of Neptune! Get away from me! Get away from me!
 You're right, Patrick. I'm sorry we destroyed your nest little worm. I promise it won't happen again.  Look, Patrick!
 Yeah. Hey! Why don't we invite Mr. Wormsley to stay at my place? At least until his nest grows back.
 Gary!  Make yourself descent.  You have a visitor.  Gary, wake up  Patrick, just bring in here, careful now, that's right.
 Oh, hi, Gary, are you ready to meet your new friend.
 That's right, say hello to Mr. Wormsley.
 Come on, little guys, let's take five and be friendly now. See just say hi. That's it, that's it And there you go. See? Friends.  Oh my goodness! Patrick, please do something. Aaaaaaaaaahhh.......
 Okay, Patrick, see you later then.  Aaaaaaaahhhh......
 ♪ Workin' at the Krusty Krab! Workin' at the Krusty Krab! La, la, la, la! Loo...♪ Squidward? Squidward?  Squidward, are you okay?
 Mr. Krabs! It happened again, Mr. Krabs!
 It's Squidward!
 What is it about the third Wednesday of every month that makes Squidward so happy?
 I didn't know your grandpa was a pirate, Mr. Krabs.
 Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
 Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
 And what are you up to on this fine, fine Monday?
 Show me what?
 Ah! You are?!
 Who are ya gonna introduce it to?
 Wow.
 But, Mr. Krabs, these are all the same size cup.
  Mr. Krabs...  it's beautifu-
 Mr. Krabs, what's a Viking?
 How long?
 And?
  Hi, Squidward!
 Mr. Krabs said you were gonna teach me all about the Vikings.
 Will ya teach me, huh?!
 Whoa....
 Squidward, do you think Vikings really drink their beverages in Viking Size?
 Do you think that-
 But-
 There's so much more about Vikings that I wanna find out.
  Thanks, Squidward!
  Dear Vikings, I am writing to ask you guys about your lives and stuff.  If you would take the time to  answer all my neat questions,  then that would be  really swell.
 Hey, Quincy! How's my favorite money-man?
 The new Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy cards come out today! So I need to take out some mon-ey.
 Sure thing, Quincy, sure thing.
 I know, I know. It's so embarrassing.  I wanted the one with the kittens on it.
 Thank you. Hm... Um, Quincy, this one is wrinkled. I couldn't possibly give this to Mermaid Man. It simply won't do.
  This one... smells funny.
 Well, I'll have you know that this is for Mermaid Man. And I'm not leaving until I have money that shows him the proper respect.  Whoa!
  Ahh, nothing quite like a relaxing stroll  deep  in Jellyfish Fields.  I'd know that sound anywhere! It's a terrifying shriek! But where's it coming from?  Patrick, what is with all the shrieking? You know I walk here on Tuesdays.
 Patrick, I know I heard a terrifying shriek.
  So, you were mimicking it. Patrick, please don't do that. It is really...
 And SpongeBob!
 Patrick is helping me to do good deeds today, like trimming your kelp garden.
  Order up! Go now, and bless the taste buds of your lucky connoisseur.
 Well, okay, you sit this one out, Squidward, this will be a special delivery from the chef.  For your dining pleasure, two double Krabby Patties cooked to perfection complimented by a side of coral bits and a jumbo diet soda, topped off with a little extra love.  Enjoy your meal!  It's the little details that they really appreciate, isn't it, Squidward?
 Nothing beats making quality food for good people with discriminating tastes.
 Yeah!
 Uh-huh.
 Testify!
 Squidward! The Krusty clientèle needs to be cuddled and treated with respect.  There, there.  Mr. Krabs will be ashamed!
 Mr. Krabs?
 What's happening, Mr. Krabs?
 Chef exchange program?
 Um, right here, sir.
  I'm sure with all my years in the kitchen, I can make something other than...  Just warming up.  Come on, SpongeBob!  Just one egg then...  No, that's not it, no...
 A Krabby Patty.
 Well, my time here is up. I am officially a Krusty Krab employee once again!
  The Krabby Patties, I almost forgot! These babies also belong to the Krusty Krab!  So long!
 I'm sorry, but I've got to go.
 Mr. Krabs?
  Mr. Kra-a-abs?!
 Mr. Krabs!
 Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
 Well, back to work.
 La, la, la, la, la, la! Wow.
 Good morning, sir. What's with the new sign?
 Oh. you mean like when Squidward had that mole taken of his—
 Morning, Squidward. Ooh! Squidward, where did you find those shoes?
 Captain! My spatula's missing, sir!
 Okay, Mr. Krabs. I really think I should be getting back to the grill, now.
 All aboard.
 Oh, boy. What a day. What's next? A zombie invasion?  Mr. Krabs, open up! We're being attacked by a bunch of zombies that look like me!
 Please, you don't understand! They're all splotchy and yellow with distended bellies!  Open up, open up, open up, open up!
 Mr. Krabs?
 Wait! They're not zombies, Mr. Krabs. They're your customers— look!
 Mr. Krabs, what have you done?! You poisoned all these people!
 Sure is glad to be back behind the grill where I belong, Mr. Krabs.
 Sorry, Squidward, you got to go lower to win.
 We're limbo dancing to get ready for the dance-a-thon auditions.
 You built us a trophy case for when we win?  Oh, you are a true friend.
 I think we better raise the bar.
 We're up, Patrick. Wish us luck, Squidward.
  You kidder. Let's go, Patrick.
 Well, see you at the finals tomorrow, Squidward.
 Yep.
 You're just not getting into the spirit of this thing, Squidward.
 How'd the audition go, Squidward?
 Impressive.  Hey, Squidward, would you be our coach for the finals?
 Yes, yes I am.
  Ready!
  How'd you know?
  I guess they're happy.
 Gee, Squidward, with your arms and legs doing all the work, I'm not really doing anything. I think I should help.
 Well, I just...
 You know what, Squidward?
 I think I'm suffering for my art now.  Good gravy. Get a load of the talent here.
  Are ya ready to go, Patrick?
 Patrick, it's me!
 Ew, what's this?
 It's an ad.  Dear Comic Book Reader.
  Have you ever thought about turning one of your poems into a hit song on the radio?
  Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit!  Can we go now? My arms are getting tired.
 You can't always trust ads in comic books. Those X-Ray specs I ordered couldn't see through people's skin at all!  Only their clothes! Plus, you don't have $100.  Patrick, could you get my wallet?
 Hey, that's my comic book money!
 Patrick.
 No.  Ow! Can I have my arms back?
 Good luck.  Coming--
 You have to think of the words yourself.
  Oh, Patrick!
 Why would I hit you with a dodgeball?
  No!
  You can play your records later, Gary. Patrick, is that why you've been having trouble writing?
 Oh, I don't even own a dodgeball. Do you, Gary?
 That's the spirit, Patrick! I'll open a window.
  Patrick, don't strain yourself.
 Come on, let's hear it!
 I don't see any dodgeballs here buddy. Just an artist and his work.
  Uh, Patrick?
  It's really loud!
  oh...hmm... how do I put this delicately-- That was the best song I ever heard!
 We need to get that song on the radio!
 Darn, I just got that arm back.
 Did you see the look on his face?
 I didn't know they could turn inside out like that. Now, how are we going to get your record on the radio?
 I got an idea!  We just have to play your record from the top of this antenna.
 Huh? Patrick--
 Well, it looks like Bikini Bottom is throwing a party. and you know what a party needs.
 Yes, that is important. But I was thinking about music! Turn it up, Patrick!
 Look at that, Patrick!
  That's not an angry mob, Patrick. It's your fan club!
 Why, he's right here. Patrick Star, Musical Genius.

 Here you go, Squidward. One, two, three and four, and uh— five and six.  That's it. That's the whole order, Squidward. There isn't a Krabby Patty behind my back or anything.
 Oh, Patty, a patty like you comes around once in a lifetime. I can't let them eat you. No, the job must come first. I can't let emotions cloud my commitment to the sacred fry cook oath: "That which is fried, must be eaten."
  I won't let you do this to Patty.
  Oh, Patty, I can't let them eat you. Your beauty must be preserved.  Amazing.
 Great idea.
  Enjoy, sir.
 What's cooking there, Patty? Oh, are you kidding? I love crepes. Oh, Patty, when we're together, I feel like we're in our own little world like, like— nothing can hurt us.  Fire!  Fire! Fire!
 It's okay, Patty, the fire's gone. You're safe now.  Oh, I better, uh— get the doorbell.
 Sorry, Patrick.  I already made plans to go for a walk through Jellyfish Fields with Patty. As soon as the little lady dries her hair, we're heading out.
 Sorry, Sandy. No time for karate today. After our walk, I'm going for a rowboat ride with Patty. Just waiting for her to put on her makeup. You know how long it takes a Krabby Patty to get ready.
  Patty. Yeah, well, you two have fun with that.  Patty and I have to be on our way.

 Good day, sir.
 Oh, I just got gussied up for my special dinner date.
 She's rich in taste.
 There she is.
  Here we are, darling. The best eatery in town.
 Mr. Krabs, Squidward— allow me to introduce my date— Patty.
 This isn't a “piece-o-meat”, Mr. Krabs. She's Patty.  And we're on a special date tonight so you don't mind if we get the "manager's treatment," do you?
 Oh, really? Mr. Fiver says different.
  How about now?
 Grrrrrazie!  Here you go, my dear. A throne befitting a queen.  Oh, good evening, monsieur. What might we have on the menu at this fine establishment?
 Don't say such a thing, Squidward. Patty's just a little sick is all. Wight, Wubbie-Lubbie.
 Squidward, what are you doing with my beautiful patty?
  Stop it, Squidward! Maybe you can't see Patty's beauty. But to me, she's the most gorgeous creature in the sea.
 Patty, you no mind to that, wubbie-wubbie. I will always love you—  Yeah, what is that smell?  Patty?  What happened to you?
 Um, not quite, Mr. Krabs.
 I see now. I see what I must do.  Oh, Patty, my darling. Before I do this, I want you to know that I only do it out of love.
  Can I get a doggie bag with that?
  And then, the ugly mollusk ran all the way home...
 Glove World! Roller coaster. First in line.
 Excuse me, which way to the Fist O' Pain?
 In the name of amusement, no...!
  I don't want to ride the Fiery Fist O' Pain!
 No! Well, yeah. It's just that I had a bad dream last night.
 What was your dream about, Patrick?
 Wait for me, Patrick.  Whoo! Fiery Fist O' Pain, here we come.
 Boy, the Fist O' Pain sounds...
 Yeah, really fun.
 That sure looks like fun.
 No tickets. I must have left it at home.
 I guess we're not gonna be riding the Fist O' Pain today.
 Oh, barnacles!.  It sure was lucky we found our tickets.
 There it is. The line looks awfully long.
 Yeah, and then the Fist O' Pain will seem even cooler.
 Can you believe some people are afraid to ride roller coasters?
 I can't believe it, Patrick. It's Glovey Glove!  Get over there and I'll take your picture with him.  Get closer, Patrick.
 Come on, closer.  That's it, a little more. Now hold onto his thumb. Give me a big smile.
  I mean, The Mitten.
 Yeah. Let's ride it just to see how baby-fied it is.
 Well, the line looks a little bit shorter now. Can you believe that some people are scared of this ride?
  We've gone eight times.
 Bye.
 Hello, Larry.
 Oh, it's, uh...  very manly, Larry.
 Um, I have a confession to make. We haven't gone on the ride because I'm... hungry. I'm very hungry. Hungry, hungry!
 No thanks, Patrick. Um, you got ice cream in your eyebrows.
 Hurry back so we can go on the ride.
 Oh, delicious dairy treat, I don't know what to do.
 I know, but the ride is really scary.
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it!
 I have to tell you something too, Patrick.
  Warning! This ride may cause: Crying, screaming, projectile vomiting, amnesia, spine loss, embarrassing accidents, uncontrollable gas...
 Is that all?
 Well, this is it, Pat.
 On the Fiery Fist O' Pain.
 We made it.
 This is it, Patrick.
 We made it!
 We're not crybabies.
 Patrick, I have a confession to make. I was really scared about going on this ride.
 I didn't know how to tell you because, well, I didn't want to disappoint you.
 But now we don't have to face our fears. The ride is broken.
 Patrick, I don't want to face my fears. I'm afraid of them!  Goodbye, Patrick.
 We conquered our fears!
 We survived the Fist o' Pain!
 Let's go again!
 Got to hurry, Gary.  The sooner I get to bed, the sooner I'll get to sleep, and the sooner I get to sleep, the sooner I'll wake up, and the sooner I wake up, ooh ho-ho!  The sooner I get to go to work at the best job in the whole wide world: The Krusty Krab!  Now, to just put on these sleepy time blinders, before I run excitedly to bed.  Well, good night, Gary.
 I'm just going to turn out the lights.  Clickety poo. And close my eyes and go to sleep.  Just close my eyes and go to sleep.  ...just close my...  Maybe if I run around it'll tire me out.  Oh, I just got to get some sleep! There's only one thing for this.  Ah, that's the stuff. A glass of warm snail milk.  Dah! Why isn't it working--  Whoa, Gary, what happened?  Agh, I'm late for work!  Oh, my gosh, only twenty seconds to go! What the...?  Bridge out?  Hopscotch!  Almost there.  No! I'm late. What's Mr. Krabs going to say?
 Order up!  Here you go, sir. One Krabby Patty, Krabby Fries, and Krabby Drink in three seconds flat.
 Not if you get up and exercise! Hut, two. Hut, two. Yes, sir. my buns are nice and toasty.
 You're welcome, Squidward.
 Yeah! Your yard is really fun! There are kids playing on it right now!
 Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet!
 Ah, perfect.
 Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet.

 Morning, Squidward. I waited for you to stop sleeping like you asked. So, you got any plans for the day, Squidward?  Okay, Squidward, I'll catch ya later.  Hi, Squidward, wanna play?
 Okay, Squidward, see ya later.
 Hey, Squidward, wanna play?  Okay, Squidward, see ya later.
 Hey, Squidward, wanna play?  Okay, Squidward, see ya later.  Hi, Squidward, wanna play hide-and-seek?

 Something tells me Squidward doesn't wanna play today. That's it. If I can't play with the real Squidward...  I'll just make one of my own!
 Just say hello to him, Squidward. You know how sensitive he is.
 Uhh, Squidward, he prefers to be addressed by his full name.
 How does he do it? Right again, Squiddy. You little charades master, you.
 Actually, Patrick, this is...
 Good one, Mini Squid! You are always such a ray of sunshine. Are you ready for another fabulous day of work at the Krusty Krab?
 Order up, Mini Squid!
 Here you go, pal!  Go get em', tiger!
 Well, ol' Mini Squidward, I guess this is it. We've had some good times playing charades and dancing around like two giddy butterflies!  Remember?
 But I guess it's time for you to move on, huh? Onto greener pastures. Arrivederci, mon frere.
  Bye-bye! What's the matter, actual-size Squidward?
 Yeah, I have something even better!  Another me!
 You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets.  Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter, a two fisted Jumper, and a gold-throated stinger!
 Oh, this year's migration is gonna be a big one!
 Wow. This looks like a job for Ol' Reliable!
 Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever.
 Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloid netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world.
 Good night, Patrick.
  Ah, I love jellyfishing.  Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable.  Ol' Reliable?  It's gone!
 Oh, right. Pants.
 Patrick, Ol' Reliable has been stolen!
 Put one over there, Patrick.
 Maybe we should spread out a little.
 Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return.
 12 dollars and...  ...38 cents.
 Oh! Hello? Hello?
 Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!
 No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net.
 Hello?!
 What?! Really, Patrick?
 Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever.
  Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net.  Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday.
  No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net?
 Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present.
  It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to.
 I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.
 I'm ready!  I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?
 No, Patrick!
 Patrick, I needed those.
 57 times.
 I'm a winner?
  I'm a winner.
  I'm a winner.
 I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner!
 I didn't get a license, Patrick.
 No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all.
 Let's just go home, Patrick.
  No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive.
 No, Patrick. No!
 I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?
 I'm here for you, buddy.
 You got a perfect score?
 Perfect score.
  Like a winner.
 Huh?
 I'm so happy for you...  Whoa!
 Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.
 Two millionth?
 Yeah, just like you.
 Can we go home now?  We've been driving around your house for hours.
 Thanks for the ride, Patrick.
 Patrick, what are you doing?
 4:00?  Who could be at the door at this hou—  Now what is it, Patrick?
 You got your license.
 You got a new boat.
  Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep.
 Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat.  I'm so tired.
 Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work.
 Thanks for the ride.
 That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...
 When did we get a drive-thru?
 I used to have a dream.
  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I—
 What's with the helmet, Patrick?
 Uh-huh.
 Oh?
  Oh, that would be great.
 Patrick!
 Mom!
 Hey.
 Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.
  40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car.
 Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?
 Are you sure you don't want to run him in?  It's a red light, Patrick!  Patrick, you just ran three red lights!
 You're suppose to stop!
  Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!
 I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!
 If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!
 Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this!
 Patrick, what do you think you're doing?
 What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait!  Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.
 Patrick!
 I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever.  Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy.
 What?
 Oh, then what do we do with this?
 Yeah!
 Ready, pal.  Woo! Woo!
  Come on, stovie, pop that corn!  Get ready, Gary.  Incoming!
 Popcorn is served!
  I want to impress and amaze my friends!
  Here it is: Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit.  Look at all this! A book of spells, my very own wand of whimsy, the beard of Rasputin, and, of course, the all-important license to practice magic.  Squidward! He'll appreciate my newly delivered skill.
 Well, let the rotting continue, friend, while I impress and amaze you with...magic!
  Silly Squidward. I won't learn vanishing spells until I become a level 10 wizard.  No, I better start with something simpler.  Say card conjuring.  Here, hold this simple, playing card while I transform it into a magic playing card before your very eyes. Let's see...  step 1...
 Which brings us to... step three. Juggle something. Well, if you insist, Mister Magic.
 Then take one card and shove it in your ear.
 You can't rush perfection.
  Always the kidder, Squidward.
 A wishing well, here? Wow!
 Yeah, Squidward, don't you believe in magic?
 Well, I do. This well's gonna make a lot of dreams come true.  What's the first thing you're gonna wish for?

 And I've got a date with a Krabby Patty.
 A promotion?  Why do I have to go down in the well?
 How long do I have to stay down here?
 Thanks for the promotion. It sure is dark and scary down here.
 Our very first wish! I can't wait till it comes...
 Gosh...  Ow!
 Hey!
 Patrick!
 Patrick, this is a wishing well. Just throw in a coin and make a wish.
 Patrick.
 Patrick, you're supposed to let go of the coin when you throw it.
 Well, we've got 6½ hours ‘til the end of my shift. What do you want to do now?
  Tag, you're it.
  Tag, you're it.
  Tag, you're it.
  Tag, you're it.
 I did great, Mr Krabs. I got a nickel from Sandy, 2 pennies from Mrs. Puff, a penny from Plankton...  ...and this slightly used pair of dentures.
 This wishing well was a wonderful idea, Mr. Krabs. Has anyone's wish come true, yet?
 Really?
 Can we come out now?
 Aww, no one's wishes are coming true. What did we do wrong? I know I believe hard enough. Maybe I just didn't dig deep enough. What do you say, Patrick? Are you ready to dig for some magic?
 ♪Oh, the magic has gone missin' and everyone's still wishin' but their dreams have fallen flat upon the ground. You'll find magic under rubble so, Patrick, grab a shovel and here is where the magic can be found. We're at the bottom of a well but man won't it be swell, when we make everyone's wishes all come true.♪  Holy mackerel, look, Patrick! We've struck magic.
 Next to being a fry cook, it's the most important thing I've ever done.
 Do you wanna make a wish?
 Guess what, Squidward? We found the magic.
 No, it's true! We did find the magic. Oh, I wish you could see it.  Squidward! You decided to join the party.
 We were just gonna play some party games.
  Tag, you're it.
 Maybe if you had more upper arm strength.
 It means he's afraid of Santa Claus.
 Stop it, Patrick, you're scaring him!
 Umm, Squidward, you're standing on my foot.
 Hey, hey, hey, guys.
  You shouldn't fight in here. This is a magical place.
 Bye, Squidward. Enjoy your trip!
 We didn't get any money. But we found something better. We found the magic.
 We dug down deeper in the well and found the magic. Now all the wishes will come true!
 That's great, Sandy!
 It's beautiful, Mrs. Puff. How's about letting me take it for a spin?
 See, Mr. Krabs? She wished for that boat.
 Is that proof enough for ya?
 Mr. Krabs! No!
 Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?
 Time off?
 Aye aye, Mr. Krabs.
  I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation.  Hey, Gary.
 That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary.  Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward.
 What's a vacation?
  No work?! But what'll I do all day?
 But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.
 Replacement?
 I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique.
 I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work.  My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside!
 I'm not here to see you, Squidward.
 I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick for lunch.
 You have my word, sir. No working.  Hey, Pat, it's time for your lunch...  Patrick, you can't do that!
 You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit.  Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty.
 Wait, it's not what you think.
 But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.
 Yes, Mr. Krabs.
 Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset.
 Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up.
  Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up.
 Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming...
 You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house.
 Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally.  Hey, that reminds me of...  Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax.  That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds.  That one's a jellyfish!  That's a pirate ship.  And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup?  Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here.
 Patrick, shhh.
 Somebody help, I'm stuck!  Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here.  Um, Mr. Krabs?  Noooo!!  Uh oh.
 Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs.
 Just take the next right.  Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off.
 My house is back that way, Mr. K.
 Where'd you say you were taking me?
 It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a...   That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them!
  Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire like that? Like trash? I don't think so!
  I've been waiting for you, Patrick!
 Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television.
  Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!
 You must've saved a fortune.
 Wow! That's more than I make in a year.
  Yippee! I happily acquiesce.
  All right, Gary, ready for your yearly shell waxing?
 Just look at that shine! Now let's check under the hood.  Geez, Gary, this place is a real snail-sty.
 Still? From New Year's Eve?  What?! I've been looking everywhere for this, Gary.  My favorite novelty t-shirt!  Oh, someone's here.
 Special delivery? Just for me? You think I'm...special?
 What could it be today, Gary?
  A videotape?  "You're a winner -- SpongeBob SquarePants". I'm SpongeBob SquarePants!
 King of Karate?
 Ooh... Did you hear that, Gary? I'm going to be crowned...  King of Karate!  Whoo-hoo!
 Hello, Sandy. Have you heard the news? I've been invited to Karate Island to be crowned the king of karate.
 Oh, sure, Sandy, all the big karate experts go there.
 Maybe your karate  the best, but now they've recognized a new number one.
 All right, Sandy, you can come with me to witness my crowning moment.  Are we there yet?
 What make you think that's Karate Island?
 Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived.
 Oh, thank you.
 Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. Mr. Udon isn't interested in a karate novice like you. He only has time for royalty.
 You hear that, Sandy? He called me "master." Bring on your best fighters! I'll try to go easy on 'em.
 Pa-shaw! Watch and learn, sister.  Yup. That's how the King of Karate does it. Who's next?
 The one and only.
 I'm ready to be King of Karate!
 My throne.
  Come, Sandy, take your place next to the king and share in my crowning achievement.  Bring a seat for my air-breathing friend.
 Oh, do I detect a note of jealousy, Sandy?
  But who's being crowned King of Karate - not you.
 Sandy's going to miss out, big time.
 No!
  Sandy, I need you! I can't handle this myself.
 No, Sandy!
 You mean I'm not King of Karate?
 Don't do it, Sandy!
 Sandy, I'm sorry I acted like a jerk back there. Thanks for saving me from...  buying a condo.
 I still have one question, though. Does this mean I'm not King of Karate anymore?
  Did you say a monster Krabby Patty?!
 The Flying Dutchman!  What are you doing in my house?
 Squidward! Squidward!  Squidward! Help!
 Squidward, you have to help me! There's a gh-gh-gh,
 PATRICK! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!  Patrick, you gotta help me! The Flying Dutch...  ...man.  Gary!  Don't you dare hurt my little Gary!
  Gary!
 It's okay, Gary.
 Goodnight, Gary.
 Um, Dutchie? Is this gonna be much longer?
 Well, you've been here a while, and, uhh, I've seen all your tricks.
 Eeeh.
 Oh, no, no. I meant that I'm just used to it, that's all.
 You just gotta scare someone other than me.
 Just what kinda talk is that? You're just off your game, that's all.
 Sure, relax a little.
  Hey, champ! How's it...
 What is going on around here?
 Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! Everyone, get out!
 Dutchie! Do you wanna spend eternity on this couch?
 Look in the mirror. You're a ghost of your former self!
 Yes, you are. But we're going to raise you up from your squalled conditions through the use of visual aids. Watch now.
 A journey into self-awareness.
 Now get off of that couch and into your clothes, Dutchman! It's time to get serious.  Let's start you off easy. You think you can take that old lady down there?
 Now that's the Flying Dutchman I know. Let's see you put those words into action.
  Now he's got him.
 Wait a minute! I think you gave me the answer to all your problems!  ...goblins...guilt trip...
  Dutchie, it worked! You got your scare back!
 And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon.
 Good Ol' Dutchie!
 Wait for it...
 Ahh, isn't it great working at the Krusty Krab, Squidward? Huh? Isn't it? Working here?
 Yeah.
 Aww, yeah.
 Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest.  Litter.  Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper?  Kids these days.  I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now.  Where is all this litter coming from?!  Not on my watch.  Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter.
 Yes.
 Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there saved room for his just desserts.  Yeah, just desserts.
 Who?
 Who?
 He seems kind of angry with us, eh, Squidward?  Squidward? Squidward?
 Hi, officers. So, he's going to jail, right?
 Yeah, Strangler.
 Hey, that looks like me!
 You nice officers will protect me, right?
 Those officers are right. I need a bodyguard!  Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard.
 This would be him, Mr. Krabs.
  Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard.
 You don't understand, mister. I need protection from the scariest guy in town. Here's his picture.
 I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty.
 Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next?
 Or that pebble.  Or that stick.  Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium!
 Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?
 We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!
 Yes, excellent.  Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands.
 Quick is my middle name!  Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard?
 I'll take both!
 Hmmm.
 I'm not sure if these are my pants.  How about this one, bodyguard? Too overbearing?
 Here we are. SquarePants Manor! Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have.
 Protect me?
 Don't mention it, Strangler.  I mean, bodyguard. Now where'd I put my key?
 Well, I can't find 'em. You wanna take a look?
 Sure! With these spiky cleats, anything is possible!  Ya!
 I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas!
 Don't be mad, bodyguard. Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside.  There you are, you little rascal. Now, to put the key in the lock, which should activate the tumblers, thus opening the door.  Step inside...
 Well, here we are!
 I know, isn't it great?  Ooh.
 A surprise party to celebrate my perfect on-time percentage at work?  Oh, how'd you guys know?
 Bye, everybody, thanks for coming! Bye Mr. Krabs, bye Plankton, bye Sandy, bye Larry, bye Pearl, bye Mrs. Puff, bye Squidward, bye, eh, the rest.  Ahh, alone at last.
 Just you, me, and the floorboards.  Yeah.
 How did you guys know today is my birthday?
 Thanks for coming!  Alone again.
 Uh-huh.
 Oh yeah.
 Wait! We can trust Patrick. He's my best friend.
 So, Patrick's the Strangler. Gee, you think you know a guy.
 He's not?
 Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream?
  Wait, bodyguard, I need protection!
 I'm not safe! Come back!
  Good idea, bodyguard. He'll never find us up here.  Good thinking, bodyguard. The Strangler could have been on that plane.  Bodyguard, bodyguard!
  The Strangler!
  Easy...  Perfection!
 Just a second, Squidward. Well, Krabby Patty, it's time for you to go now.  You grew up so fast, I...  Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't do this.  Just take it Squidward, take it away.
  That's me!  Mmm. My compliments to the chef!  Hello, what's this?
  Mr. Krabs?
  What's a hidey-hole?
 What's in this thing? Treasure?
 Why'd you dig up your navy chest, sir?
 Wow, look at all your cool navy stuff! What's that?
 Neat.
 How'd you win that?
 Wow! Oh-oh. Who are those guys?
 Did you have a cool nickname, Mr. Krabs?
 You were?
 Well, I guess you were thinner back then.
 You want me to punch you in the stomach?
  wow, my entire arm disintegrated.
 Aye, aye, sir!  Alright, let's get this place ship shape. You men, stop laying around!  To battle stations.  All hands on deck!  Set course for full flavor.  Ketchup and mustard off the port bow.  One Krabby Patty ready to set sail.
  Mr. Krabs.  Hello? Mr. Krabs?  You alright? Are you sleepy?  Mr. Krabs!  I don't smell his pulse.  What's that?  Is somebody there?
  You're alive! And naked...
 What's molted?
 Wow.
 Barnacles!
 Sorry about the foul language, Mr. Krabs, but you're acting like there never was a man in that shell. The Krabs of his navy days was fearless. He wouldn't let something as insignificant as a missing shell slow him down.
 Who cares how silly, pink & fleshy you look. How non-threatening, limp & soft you are. How...  ...oops.
 Wow, it sure is dark in here.  Look, Mr. Krabs, I'm you!
 Well, I'm glad you got my point. It's not what's about on the outside. It's what's on the in...
 I get to be a navy buddy?
 Oh, that'll be a snap. Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years.
  Look at me, I'm Mr Krabs. I love money.
 I once won a marathon because someone dropped a penny at the finish line.
 Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story.  Goodnight, wallety.
 Oh, what's that you say? Me daughter, Pearl, needs an operation? I'll do it me self and save a nickel.
  Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had.
 Well, time to punch that clock. But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar.  You are a winner.  And today's the first day of summer!  Happy first day of summer, Squidward!  Care to join me for solstice caroling?  Walking in the grass, it's so fine, don't need shoes in the summertime!
  Yeah.
  Gee, Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever!  What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?
 The money?
 Oh.
 Tell me more about summer break.
 I've been taught the true meaning of summer.
  Almost closing time, Mr. K.
 Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there.
 See anything, Mr. Krabs?
 The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.
 You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey!  Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment.  Huh?
 Krabby Land, sir?
  Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?
 Stall 'em? How do I do that?
  Hey, kids!
 No, I'm not. I'm, uh...  I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!
 Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles?
 Well, you've never seen my bubbles.  Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?
  Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins.  Ta-da!  Uh... huh.
 Okay, uh... and now for a finale!  Oops.
  My eyes!  Whoa!   They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery.  Hey, kids, check this out.
 I got 'em right where I want 'em.
  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
 Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.
 The kids are using them as... boomerangs.
 What are we gonna do?
  Really? He's here?  Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
  Listen, everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!
 Who do you want?
 When do you want him?
 I'll say you have.
 Closing time.  The saddest time of the day!  Huh?  It's a Krabby Patty.  Eww... It's cold and hard.  This could have rolled under there years ago.  There, there, little one, your journey is almost over.
 But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill.
 But it's old and cold. And so very full of mold.
 Order up, Squidward.
 Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders.
 Because it growled at me.
 Yes, Mr. Krabs?
 Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings.  He won't like it!
 Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive!  Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?
 Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'.
 Yes sir.  Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility...
 Aye, aye, sir.
 Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs.
 Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning.
 Wait just a burger-flipping second!
 That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea.
 I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.
 Mr. Krabs!
 Mr. Krabs!
  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!
 Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing.
 No.
  So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work.  I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink.
  Patrick, I'm scared!
 We are camping.
 Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us?
 Okay. Have fun inside.
 Just... have fun inside! See you tomorrow.
 What?
 What?
 But all I...
 Okay. Have fun inside!
  Squidward's gonna come camping with us!
 That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside?
  Customization!
  Time for Boating School! Let er rip, Gary.  Ahh...  Ta-da! Not bad, partner in crime. The toast could have been a little darker, though.  See you later.
 Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today.
 I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone?
 Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me?
 You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it!
 Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime.
 Behold, Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning.  And this is the Fountain Of Learning.  And these are the Lockers Of Learning.
 No, they're just the stairs.  These are the Stairs Of Learning.
 I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'till 9:00.
 Late for being early.
  And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom.
  And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge.
  And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board.
  Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too.  There you are.
 Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem!  74.
 I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project.
 The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat.  This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes, Roger would die.
 Patrick!
 The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair?
 This is gonna be great!
 You, Patrick, she's the teacher.
 I guess it's just in the timing.
 Hey, Patrick.
 I thought of something funnier than 24.
  25.
 Yes, Mrs. Puff.
  Big Fat Meanie? Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!
 No...
  I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!
  No!   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
 What, me? But why?
  Thanks a lot, Patrick.
 Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here.  It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway?  'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?
  Just ignore him, SpongeBob.
 Whatever you do, don't look at him.
  What?
  HI?!
  There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!
 Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one!
 It is after class!
 They're talking about us! We're fighting!
 Detention!?
  In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg.  It's all Stupid Patrick's fault.  I hate you, Patrick.
 I'd hate you no matter what.
  I'd hate you even if that made sense.
 I'd hate you, even if, uhh...  Um, I'd hate you...  even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out.  Huh?
  Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty.
 I respect you, Barnacle Man!
 Evil?
 Holy oil spill! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch enemies: Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble!
  Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself?
 You can't give up. What if we help you?
 Okay!
 I do!
 Wow! The Mermalair!
 Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were the most heroic heroes ever! And you had the best lunch box, too.
 Want to see me run to that mountain and back?  Want to see me do it again?
 Holy halibut! It's the chief!
 Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef!
  Make that two!
 Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off!  Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off!
 Get it off! Get it off!  Whew...I'm glad that's over!
 Good morning, pineapple!  Good morning, Gary!
  Good morning, world! I'm ready! World?
 Squidward's last name is Tentacles?
  Fancy. So that's what came in the mail. Looks like Gary has a new little playmate.
 Training?
 Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day!
 Boy, you got that right. Gary's no...  hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race?
 You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine.
 Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
 Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail!  Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies!  I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use.
 Kelp powder for muscle mass.  Raw eggs, 'cause they're cliché.  And nails for toughness.
 Of course, I expect you to eat this.  It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary?  Wow, pretty good time.
 Patrick, your snail is a rock.
 Boy, the competition's getting tough.  That's it, Gary.  We are going to start some serious training right now.
  Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints.  On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary!  Gary?  Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win.
 Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do.
 Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious.  Come on, Gary, move it!  Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down!  Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go!  Come on, push it, Gary, push it!  Move that shell!  Come on, Gary, move it!  Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster!  Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it...  Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke.  Come on, Gary, we're gonna be late for the big race!
 Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape for the rest of his life.
 No, Patrick, that's the official.
 Alright, Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it.
 What!
 What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it!
 Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now!  Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary!  Go, go, go, go, go!
 Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster!
 Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?!
 Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster!  Huh?
 Uhh, Gary?
  Umm, Gary, you can stop now!
 You can take a break now if you want to, Gary.
 No!  Hold on, Gary, I'm coming!
  Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!
 You did?  Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!
 You did?  Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary!
 Gary?  Oh!
 Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?
 Hey, Squidward, check this out.  Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become...
  Heave-ho!
 But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad.
 Patrick?
 Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on.  Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?
 Patrick, we're not getting paid at all.
 Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff.
 First, we need to set up the tarp.
 We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick.  Now that's what I'm talking about. Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now.
 And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off.
  Patrick, the lid's already off.
 I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick!
 Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready.  Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush.  All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go.
  Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall.
  I'm getting to the painting.
  No problem. Here I go.  Yeah! Huh?!  Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?!
 Noooooo!  Patrick?
 I don't think this bubble can get much bigger!
 Pat, no!  We did it!  We painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the--  Flappin' Flotsam! What's that?!  We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?
 That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!
 Okay,  this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off.  There! I think I got it.
 This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar…
 But Mr. Krabs said…
 Did it work?
 Did it work?
 Did it work?
  Nothing's working!
 It didn't work.
 Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet.
 Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick, no!  No…why'd you put it in the...  Grab it, Pat, grab it! Hurry, hurry!  Aww, Pat, no, no!  Get it, Pat, get it, get it, get it!  Oh, no-ho-oh!
 Okay, okay, we still have time!  Don't panic, SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome!
  Hurry, Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea!
  We're all done, sir. Everything looks great.
 Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going...
  Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me!
  It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!
 Hi, Mr. Krabs.
 Oh, you know, just hanging around.
  No, No, Mr Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!
 We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!
 You mean our butts?
  Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!
 Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on.
 What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out.  What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary?  Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear?
 Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right?
 Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep.  Robot! Oh my gosh!  Huh?
 I surrender! Oh.
 Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose?
 #17 --  Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh?
  There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you?
 Well, keep your eyes peeled.  They're everywhere. Back to work!
 That sounds like Mr. Krabs.
 That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels "recharged."  If I didn't know better, I'd say he was...  ...a robot! Nah.
 Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's...  ...a robot? Nah.  Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot!
 I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too.
 Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs!
 Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it.
 Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward?
  Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's...  ...a robot!
 Hey, Mr. Krabs!
 Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad?
 Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either.
 That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love.
 Hey, Mr. Krabs!
 I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you!
  Squidward?
 Mr. Krabs!
 Mr...
 Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries.
  Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy!
 Squidward, the robots are running the Navy!
 I don't know!  Hey, a nickel!
 Sorry.
 Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot.
 Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information.
 I can't take it!
 Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch!
 Oh, yeah.
 Right.
 Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear?
 Where's Mr. Krabs?
 This is one stubborn robot.
 I got an idea.  Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robot tricks.  If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will.
 Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his "little buddy."
 I guess it didn't know anything.
  This is the last robot, Squidward.
 I also said they couldn't love.
 Uh, at least he's not laughing.
 The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their...  imagination.  Hey, it's time to feed Gary.
  Gary, the paper's here!  You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section!  I am a happy sponge!
 Oh, hey, Patrick.  Well, I'd better get going.
 I didn't say anything, either.
  Alright, quit messing with me, I know you said something.
 It's a baby scallop.
 No, Patrick! It's totally helpless.  It looks like he can't even fly yet.
 No, Patrick, he's just a baby.  He's all alone with no one to take care of him.
 You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple.  Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in.  There you go. It's the best seat  in the house.
  Is it true? Are you hungry?
 I've got just the thing.  How would you like a Krabby Patty?
 Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty.
 Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before.
  French fries?
  All we have left is this apple.
 Of course, scallops love worms.
 Well, you should be good for the rest of the...
 I don't know! Aww, don't cry.
 Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah, look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, look at the funny face!  Look at the funny face!
 How did you know?
 Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.
 You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves.
 I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.
  One, two, three. One, two, three.
  "The Krusty Krab Employee Manual; 2nd Revised Edition; Page 35; Section 19; Clause 3a, states: All staff must remain on the premises until the day's receipts are fully accounted for".
  "Clause 3b: The provider reserves the right to be unfair".
  No.  Whew.
 Squidward, you're making a big mistake!
 But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy. And what could be better than serving up smiles?
 I never knew you felt so strongly about it.
 Well, I guess I can't stop you. But Squidward, it's a cold, cold world out there. No one's going to serve you happiness on a silver platter.
 Cookies!
 Anyways, I just want you to know, if you ever get in trouble, come find me. I'll take care of you. 'Cause you and me...  ...we're like brothers, only closer.
 Or a football playing king in space...with a mustache.
 Squidward? Squidward, is that you?
 It's me, SpongeBob.  We used to work together.
 There ya go. So, where you living these days?
 Great. And what have you been doing with yourself? No, wait, let me guess...Hmmm...I see you've been working on that mustache, the tattered clothes, the awful smell...you're a football player?
 A spaceman?
 A football playing king in space--
  Even your paintings?
 There, there. You can come live with me.  Here you go, Squidward. You can sleep in my bed.
  Nonsense. You stay as long as you need to.  Good night, my little angel.  Breakfast is ready! You're gonna need to build up your strength again so I laid out a big buffet for you.
 Ahh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Here comes the plane.
 It's no trouble. Is there anything else I can do for you, winner?
 Oh, wow. Nurturing a broken spirit sure is a lot of work. I'm bushed. Still, it feels nice to do good.  Good night, Gary.
 Good night.
 Here you go.
 Good night.
  Gary! Squidward is not a freeloader and he would never take advantage of me.
 He's just having a hard time getting his confidence back.
 I'm sure he's close to a breakthrough.
  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? Must... get... autograph!
  Autograph!
 Can I have your autograph, can I have your autograph, can I... they're gone.  Mermaid Man's belt!
 Hey, guys! Wait up!  I've got something for you...
 You forgot your belt! You forgot—  Mermaid Man's secret utility belt. The emblem of submersible justice! For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations... and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands. Well, I guess I should return it.  Or not.  I could just hang onto it till after work... all alone with Mermaid Man's belt. I wonder what this button does.  Whoa.  The small ray.
  There you go. Come again, sir.
  I don't know.
 Nothing.
 Nothing.
 No, no!
 Yes.
 Me, uh... either.
 Please don't tell!
 Please don't tell!
 Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure! Please don't tell!
 Don't!
 No!
  Do-o-o-n't!
  I'm begging you!
 I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it!
 Uh... uh, okay, uh...
 Uh...  Uh...
 Uhh, I can do it!
  No! I can't let you do that! But there must be someone else who can help! Someone smart and wise, with years of life experience.  Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!
 Patrick, I was at work, and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look.
 No, Patrick!
 Patrick!
 Patrick, no! That's not an action figure! That's the real Squidward! I shrunk him by accident.
  Wait, you don't understand! This is serious! I don't know how to unshrink him! He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life.
 You think so?
 Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing!
 What?
 Patrick, I don't think Wumbo is a real word.
 Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you.
 Oh no!
 Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too!
  No! He can never find out! But I'll think of something. I promise.  Until then, you'll be safe in this jar.
 It's only two people no big deal, nobody else saw it.
  Sandy!
 I'm sorry, Sandy! Mermaid Man came in and...
  Whoo! I'm gonna have to get a bigger jar.
 Oh, Squidward, he'll be so disappointed.
 You don't understand!
 Mom?
 Mermaid Man? I'm so sorry, it's just that I'm such a big fan, and your belt, and...
 I've got it!  Ta-da!  Since I couldn't make you big, I made the city small!  And now, only one more thing to shrink. Cheese!
 See anything yet, Patrick?
 That's me!
 Thank you!
 Thirty more seconds, Patrick.
 Easy... easy...
  Pretty smart, huh?
 Squidward, we don't need a television. Not as long as we have our...  ...imagination!
 With...  ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate!  Arrrrr! A football player!  Hup!
 Sure, Squidward.
 Okay, Squidward, but if you change your mind, we'll be in this box!
 Let's go for it!  Gloves!
 Hats!
 Underwear!
 Okay, Patrick, climb up there and secure this rope.
 Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, you're going too high!
 Take it easy, Patrick, you've got to acclimate!
 Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! I think we should keep our voices down! We might start an avalanche!
 I said, I think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches!
 Our voices!
 Hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way!
 No, Patrick, I can't do that!
 Because I already cut off my own arms!
  Good one, Squidward.
 Like you don't know.  Saying,  "I hate Krabby Patties."  That's hilarious! Everyone loves Krabby Patties.
  You're good at that.  Hey, everyone! Squid says he doesn't like Krabby Patties. Ha!
  Sorry, Squidward, it's just so funny. You know what we say.
 What?
  What? What did you say?
 I'm sorry... I don't...
 Those words. Is it possible to use them in a sentence together like that?
  Never had a Krabby Patty?! Well, you've got to have one right now!  No wonder you're always so miserable! Here, try this.
 If you try it, you'll love it!
  Sorry, Patrick.  Come on, you're gonna—
 Open up the tunnel, here comes the train. Choo-choo...
  Whoop! What's that in your ear?
 Come on, open wide!
 But it's good for you!
 No, Squidward, I meant... good for your .
 Okay, just half.
 A quarter?
 One bite?
 Just smell it.
 Come on, Squidward.
 One bite.
 You won't be sorry.
 It's delicious...
 Ahhhhh...  Eeeeee.... Oooooh-oooooh-oooh...
 But—
 But, it doesn't make any sense. The Krabby Patty is an absolute good.  is immune to its tasty charms.
 Are you sure?
 No.
 I didn't think it was possible, but, I guess some people just don't like Krabby Patties.
 Yes, Squidward?
 Coming right up!  Listen, Squidward. I want to apologize for before. I was only trying to make you happy.  But I guess deep down inside, I was trying to make myself happy, but now I've learned there's room for all kinds of people in this crazy old  ...and they all don't have to like the same things.
 ...And while I strongly disagree with your decision, I accept it.  You know, it's not often I get to make one like this. I want to see the look on their face when they take that first bite.  Triple Krabby Supreme! Triple Krabby Supreme! Did somebody order a Triple Krabby Supreme? Huh, they must've left.
 Noooope, a patty this special should be eaten fresh, and... well... I haven't had one of these babies in over twenty minutes, so...  Well, whoever they were, they had great taste!  Ahh, they don't know what they're missing. Well, back to work!
 Oh no, what's this doing here?! This patty should be cremated!  I know you didn't like him, but... it means so much that you came.
 Squidward?  Is that you?
 I always come to work at 3:00 A.M. This is when I count the sesame seeds.  What are you doing here?
 And why is the patty vault open?
 And why are you holding a patty behind your back?
 And why are you acting so nervous? And why are you sweating so much? And why do you look so hungry? And...
 You like Krabby Patties, don't you, Squidward?
 I knew it all along, Squidward. No one can resist a Krabby Patty!  Squidward! How many are you eating? Squidward!  Squidward, you can't eat all those patties at one time! Squidward!
 No, worse, it'll go right to your thighs...!
 ...and then you'll blow up!
 But, Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry.  The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe.
 What can I get for you...handsome?
  Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up!  He wants one of everything.
 Try the Krusty Kelp Dog, sir!
 The Powdered Driftwood is exquisite.
 More Diet Red Tide?
 And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal?
  He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!
 Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor.
 Duped!
 We've been smeckledorfed!
 I bet he bites whale bubbles.
 It doesn't seem right...  ...but it feels so good!  Seahorse radish: the gnarliest stuff in the ocean.
 Oops, I dropped it in the toilet!
 I call it the 'Nasty Patty'.
  Here you go, sir, enjoy.
 Phew, that's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it.
 Why, sir?
 Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?
 But you told me to give it to him!
 You're right, Mr. Krabs, I'm guilty. I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me.
  Eww, gross, germs, it's all icky and corpse-y!  Eww...eww...
 Yes, sir.
 There's a big rock in the way!
  Aye aye, sir!
 What do you mean, Mr. Krabs?
  Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought he might need some air.
 Shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf?
  What a brave man, going in the line of duty like that. Why...why...why?!
 Mr. Krabs, I'm too young to go to jail!
 Can I lose my cool now?
 Oh, Neptune! Get away!  Ooh...ahh-ahh...  A-hem... Okay! All set back here. Nothing unusual about a muddy shovel in the trunk.
 Ahh...
 I understand, Mr. Krabs, but what do you want me to do with the bo...
 Oh, man, this is so gross!  The back door is locked! What am I gonna do?!
 Well, the back door was locked, so I came around here...eh.  So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go put my hat in the freezer now.
 The dark deed you requested is done, sir.
 What? You can't pin this whole rap on me!
 It was all Mr. Krabs' idea.
 He wears curlers to bed!
  It's the zombie!
 Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!
 What a beautiful day.
 Can you believe that sun?
 Uhh, Patrick?
 Nothing.
 I don't know. Let me check.  Looking good. How's yours?
 Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard.
 What a guy. Is it any wonder he's so popular? Just imagine... if I were a lifeguard.  That would be so cool.
 Who needs to be a lifeguard? I'm cool.  I'm every bit as cool as Larry. And if I'm not, let me be struck by...  ...a flying ice cream truck.  And live!
 Lifeguard?
  White stuff. You think I'm a lifeguard?
 You really think so?
 (high voice) I'd love it!
 Hi.
 It works.  Woohoo! That was the greatest, Larry.
 By myself?
 I'm not just ready.  I'm ready, Freddie.
 Action?
  I'd better call the doctor, 'cause I've got spring fever! Good morning, little flowers.  Hello, Squidward, isn't it a lovely day?
 Have you said hello to the flowers yet?
 Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever. I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers.  You're on your way. I bet you're thirsty.  Huh?  I'm not taking my eyes off you.
 Ah, yes. How foolish of me.  Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit.  And I won't do anything else.
  Oh, I'll be changing, alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah!  Hi-yah!  Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah!
 Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready!  Ready to get it on.  Hi...
  Great minds think alike, I suppose.
 I may be down, but I'm not out!
  Hi-yah! Sandy?
 Oh, I get it. She's "Sandy." That's her name; she's also covered in... yes!
 Ew.
 Yeah, let's go in.
 Wow.
 How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup?
 It's on!  If I could just run this under some hot water...
 Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes.
 Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong in Weenie Hut Jr's?
 Super Weenie Hut Jr's?
  What weenies. Oh, brother.
 What? But I'm not a weenie!
 That's impossible!
  I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie!
 So, your name's Reg?
 Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will!
 Hey, everybody, what's goin' on?
 I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order.  So, uh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate?
 Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap.
 Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch.
  I am not a weenie!
 My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's.
 Patrick, what're you doing here?
 I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only way of getting into the Salty Spitoon!
 I've got no choice.
 Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it!
 Afternoon, Reg.
 Well, that makes me pretty mad.
 Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury.
 Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny.
  I, uh...  don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy!
 Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners!
 I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby!
 Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember?
 I did?
 Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life!  Sandy?  What happened?
 I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos.
 Weenie Hut General?
  Two soups, please. Thank you.  You keep the change.  What?  I saw it! It was big! It was all wiggly! And it ate everything!
 It was an Alaskan... Bull... Worm!
  What? But, Sandy, you don't know what you're up against. We're talking about an Alaskan... Bull... Worm!
 But, Sandy, you don't know!
  Sandy! Sandy!
 Wait! Sandy!
 Sandy, don't go!
 Sandy, I saw it! It's big... scary... and pink!
 You'll get massacred!
 Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail?
  Um, I do?
 Um... in my pocket.
  No, it's not. This is your tail.
  How would you know?! It's always behind you! Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go!
 Oh, yeah? What if I said... 'blargen-fezibble-nukhip'?
  You know, tails are so overrated. Let's just forget about it and go home.  I've got ice cream! With nuts...  Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm! Y'all come back here, young lady!
  Sandy, if you want to get to that worm, you're gonna have to go through me!  Sandy, no! I can't let you! I'm not gonna let you get killed. If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure!
  No, not tough enough. Not tough enough!
 You are.
  You did.
  You do.
 Okay.
 There isn't anything...
  Ain't nothin'  too big or too ornery for you to catch. But...  But...  And...  We...  I...  Yeah but...
 You see...
 I...
 Sandy, are you sure you...?
 Sandy, that's not...!
 Sandy, that's not...!
 Sandy!
  Sandy...?
 That's not the worm.
 That's not the worm. That's his tongue.
 So what's the plan, Sandy?
 I could've thought of that. Hey, wait a minute! I was right, wasn't I?!
 Ah, he is too big for you, isn't he?
 I wanna hear you say it!
 Say it!
 Say it, or I'll trip you!
 Say it!
 Say it!
  I knew it.
 Uh, Sandy?
 What do we do now?
 I'm way ahead of you, Sandy.  Look, it's a necklace! S for "SpongeBob" or S for "Sandy"! That way they can identify our bodies.
 Yay! He'll never get out of there!
 Yay! Let's go tell everybody!
  Psst, try the coral bits.
 What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
 Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.
 Wow, a trip!
  Did you hear that? We get an assignment!
  Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight?
 Yeah, I know!
 Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?
  This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?
 You are the teacher? To my pupil? This isn't art class, it's Heaven.
 I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles.
 Yes, please.
 I have no talent.
 Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
 If I'm lucky,  Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art.
 How's this, Squidward?
 Well, first I draw this head.  Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy.
 Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try.  Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog. That's you on the bottom.
 I call it: Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped of paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time.
 I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen.
  How's this Squidward?
 Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons.  I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence.  I don't even deserve to use your doors!
 But I did deserve that.  I deserved that, too.  And I deserve this!
 Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness.
 Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame.  These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy. I can't look at them.
 Really?
 Really?
 Really?
 Wow.  Really?
  Squidward, look. It's ol' Bold and Brash!
 I... can't!
 I did it, Squidward.
 I don't know, Squidward. That stuff's not in the book.
 That's not in the book, either.
 Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it.  Ta-da!
 First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept.
 I've gotta embrace the marble!
 I've gotta sniff the marble!
 I've gotta lick the marble!
  I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble!  I've gotta be the marble! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within.
 With this tool, I shall give birth to art.
 But, one more thing.  There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in.  It looks like the excitement of my artistic triumph is too much for Squidward. Oh, well, back to the dump.   ♪To the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. To the dump, to the dump, To the dump, dump dump. ♪
 Wow! Now we never have to stop working!
 Isn't this great, Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working!  It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease!  Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!
 Good! 'Cause we've got customers!
 Psst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen  at night!
  Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm chopping lettuce...at night.  Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night.  I burned my hand!...at night.  Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! Night!
 All right!  Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash...at night.  You mean outside?
 I don't know, Squidward,  it's kinda dark out there.
 You're right!  For the Krusty Krab!  Piece of cake!
 Pfft, nah.
  What? What do I know?
 Tell me! Tell me!
  What happened, what happened, what happened!?
 The Slash-Bringing Hasher?
 The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa.
  Tell me the story!
 He forgot the secret sauce?
 He didn't wash his hands?
 Irregular portions?
 You mean like this?  Or like this?  Or this?  Or this?  But what about this? Or this, or this, or this, or...
  So?
  Oh, no!
 Tuesday.
  But tonight's Tuesday night!
 How will we know?
 No.
 What?
 What?
 What?
 It's not?
 Ohhhhh.
 Okay. Ready, Patrick? One...
  Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing?
 Here's your net.  Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves.
 Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box!
 It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets.
 I've got a gazillion secrets!
 Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly.
 You wanna hear one of my secrets?
 Uhh... Let's see...  Did you know that you're my best friend?
 Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naïve.
 Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think Jelly-Fishing and Bubble-Blowing are the…  ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word "fancy" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear, right now.
 Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?
 Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uh…  I've got my secret socks on.  And my secret Gary's bowl!  My secret TV!  And my secret TV channel.  What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?
 But, Patrick, I must know the secret!
 Come on, Patrick, just a peek?
 But... we're supposed to be...  friends forever.  I feel so filthy!  I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself!  I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!
 So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?
 What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish!  Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds.  Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victims' severed heads in a box.  Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party!  I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do!  That's it! How do you look in a secret box?  Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back.  Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary?
 Oh, what do you know? You're a snail!
  I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up.
  Shhh!
 Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper.
 Uh…
 Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop!  It's me, SpongeBob!
 No, really, Patrick! Look!
 If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside.
  Really?
 Okay! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes!  Huh?
 It's just a string.
 Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that!  Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow!
 I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along!  Wait 'till I tell Gary!
 Look, Mr. Krabs. I'm doing it, I'm doing it!
 Why, yes. Yes I am.
  The Krabby Patty formula is the sole property of the Krusty Krab and is only to be discussed in part or in whole with its creator, Mr. Krabs. Duplication of this formula is punishable by law. Restrictions apply, results may vary.
 SpongeBob.
 Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, as long as these pants are square,  and this sponge is Bob,  I will not let you down!
 Code twelve, code twelve!  Your disguises can't fool me this time, Plankton!
 Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was just trying to protect the secret formula.
 No free napkins?
 Only discuss the formula with Mr. Krabs.
 Hi, Mr. Krabs.
 No sign of Plankton, yet. Gosh, Mr. Krabs. You don't look so good.  Ooh, you're so cold.
 I got it, I got it. I got it, I got it
  Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happened to your metal pants?
 You gave him the day off.
 Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir!  Hey, Mr. Krabs, just taking out that garbage.
 Whoa-ho, Mr. Krabs. I didn't know you had heat vision.
 But I thought you wanted to ask me a question.
  I don't know, Mr. Krabs... I don't know.
 Mr. Krabs...  Wha...
 Scrub-a-dub-dub, I love to rub.  Hey, Mr. Krabs, just doing a little scrubbin'.
 I can see that, Mr. Krabs.
 Isn't that a microphone?
 But, sir, we haven't done the secret handshake yet.
  We don't shake with our hands, remember?
 We stand on one foot.  Balance a glass of chocolate milk on our heads and sing the Bikini Bottom National Anthem.
 Gee, Patrick, I didn't know you spoke bird.
 This whole sack?
 Uh sorry, I don't speak Italian.
 What's that lump in its belly?
  Wait! You forgot about this pet!
 Look at him Patrick, isn't he great? Hey, little fella.
 Aw look, isn't he just precious? Let's take him out to play.  998, 999, 1, 000. Ready or not, here I come!
 I know, Patrick, days like today only come once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Savor every moment. And it's all thanks to Wormy. I made this for Wormy.  Our new best friend.  Until tomorrow, new best friend. Don't be sad, little buddy. We'll be back first thing in the morning for frolic and fun.
 Aw, don't be sad, Patrick. [cut to Bikini Atoll] It's only until tomorrow.
  Hey everybody! It's Leif Ericcson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgin! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Ericcson Day! There's a note.
 Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me.  Another note.
 I don't get it. The water's fine.  Hey, Squidward! Want to play?
 Are you sure?
 Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy!  Nah...  Rock Buddy! Nope...  Sink Buddy! "[Sink Buddy drips a little water]" Almost...  I've got it!  Bubble Buddy!  This...is...great!  I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs.  Don't be shy, come on!
 Hi, Squidward!
 I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy!
 Oh, I'm not hungry.
 Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet!
 He's hungry.
 Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you.  Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just have one of everything.
 Bubble Buddy's thirsty.
 Sounds great!
 Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws.  Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think?
 Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties!
 Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do?
 Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch.
 Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward...
 That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs!
 Here we are, Bubble Buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here.
 See what I mean?  All done!
 Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get some cotton candy.
  My friend's in there.
  Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah!
 Hey, Pearl! Shake hands with Bubble Buddy!  It's his first time on his own.
 Hey, Bubble Buddy, you're finished!
  Hey, everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy?
 Hey, is this one of those sewing circles?
 Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable.
 Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern.
  Why?!
 No! I won't let you!  Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha haa! Never!  Never...
 No! You can't! He's not just a bubble, he's a Bubble Buddy! He's my friend and I love him! Haven't you ever had a very special friend?
 So, what do you say?
 Noo...
 So long.
 Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes!  Seems like only this morning I held his bottle.  They blow up so fast.
  Hold still, Gary.
 Almost done.
 That's great, Patrick. What's it for?
  "For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?"
 Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake.
 Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?
 Exactly!
 No, don't! That's my...  ...award closet.
  Aww, Patrick, don't cry.  You'll get an award one day.
 But you're Patrick...  Star. You can do anything you want.
 Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.
 Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?
 Smaller.
 Smaller.
  The smallest you can think of.
  Yeah!  I do things at work all the time.
 And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?
 You have to work for it, remember?
  Pick up order!
 No, you have to take the tray to the customer.
 Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table.
 Nope.
 Let's try something different.
 All you have to do is answer the phone.
 Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant.
 It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out?
 You'll do fine.
 Keep trying, Patrick.
  Kitchen!
 Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar.  Easy. Now you try. First get a jar.  Patrick, that's a pickle.
 You need a jar.  No.  No.  No. Try...this!  Now take the lid off the jar.  Just relax. Lift your hand.  Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid.  No, the lid.   Freeze!  Almost there. Now head for the lid.  Cold.  Warmer.  Warmer.  Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!
 Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do.  Exactly as I do.  Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.
 No, no, Patrick, you did it!
 That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it.
 Oh, yeah.
  Yeah.
 Patrick, you do exactly what I do and you'll have an award in no time.  I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready.
 Wow. It's amazing how a simple change of clothes can make a guy look...just...like...me.
 That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready...  Huh?
 Well, back to the ol' grind.
 Forget my hat.
  Dropped my spatula.
 Aha!  You're copying me!
 Why are you doing that?
 Well, it's annoying, so stop it!
 Say, you're good.
  At least I'm safe inside my mind.
  Stop copying me!
  Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?
 We'll see about that!
  I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.
 Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice.  Ha! Not a scratch on me.
 Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?
  I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me.  Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.
 But, Patrick...
 Another trophy?
 'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'.
 Patrick! This trophy's for you!
 So, what are you gonna do, now?
 I was just testing it.
 One Krabby Patty coming up!
 Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table nine.
 Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?
 The hooks?
  What could be worse than that?
  Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs.
 Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
 Hey, Patrick.
 I can't leave now. I'm working.
 Where is everybody?
 Doesn't look like any carnival I ever...  Excuse me.  Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous!
 All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!
 Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahh, what a beautiful day!  I wonder if Patrick's at home.
 Goin' over to Sandy's place.  Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place.
 What is it?
 Texas? What's a Texas?
 All right then. Let's make one of your treedome.
 Sandy? Hi-yah!
 Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy.  Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah!
 Uhh, Sandy?  Surf's up, Sandy!
  Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing!
 Look, Sandy, we caught one!
  We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!
 Go on, go back to where you belong.  Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them. Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind. Remember: there's no place like home!  Sandy, what the heck are you crying about?
  Sandy...
 Homesick, huh?  Almost there.
 Da-ta-dah.
 Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!
 Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.
  There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: "The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt".
 Take a break and play around with us.
 I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!
  I already took care of it.
 My turn.  One, two, three, four.  Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way.  Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.
  Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs.
  You are a real pirate. Go straight to the "X" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs!
 Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.
 I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.
 I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.  See you tomorrow.  Huh? Who's there?
  Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs.
 Mr. Krabs, you gotta...
 But, Mr. Krabs...
 But, Mr...
 But, Mr...
   Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?
 Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.
 Pirates?
 Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches.
  Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate!
 Ow.
 Really? Can we see the map?
 Okie dokie, then.
 Okie... oops.  I mean...  arrgh! Captain Krabs.  Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh...
 The whole ship is underwater captain.
 But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has...  Which way, captain?
 Mr. Krabs, we're tired.
  Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew.
 I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.
 But we've only been gone a few hours.
 I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!
 He's not here.
 Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.
 Patrick, what are you doing?
 Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map.
 No, guess there isn't.  Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself.
 Yeah?
 You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?
 Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!
  Look! It's the "X".
 Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map.
 We got it, Captain Krabs.
 What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?
 We found it together. So we deserve a share!
 What about loyalty?
 And one for all.
 And one for all.
 And one for all.
 And one for all.
 Wow!
  Happy Valentine's Day, Bikini Bottom!
  Well, I'm bubbles for you, Sandy.
 Okay.  Step one:  Patrick and I get to the Valentine's Day carnival.  Step two: I position Patrick and myself on top of the Ferris wheel.  Step three: You arrive at designated checkpoint for maximum visual contact.  Step four: Patrick is thrilled. Mission accomplished.  Hi, Patrick.
 Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob.
 Patrick!
 Patrick...
 Patrick, I'm right behind you!
 And I have a present for you!
 It's the greatest...  ...the bestest...  ...the most fantabulous...  ...present ever!  But you can't have it yet.
 Because it's not ready yet.
 Not yet.
 Do you want to ruin the surprise?
 Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
 Hmmm...nope, sorry.
 No can do!  You'll just have to wait!
 Okay, Patrick, here we are
 It's not the carnival.
  Here, why don't you take this quarter and...
 It's not the quarter.
 Now, take that quarter and buy some cotton candy...
 Ten-four, Sandy, SpongeBob here.
 Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is.
 You'll have to guess!
 No.
 No.
  Nope.
 Are you sure?  SpongeBob to Sandy, you can bring it in now.
 Late? But what about...  ...Patrick?
  If Patrick doesn't get his valentine...
 Patrick! Uhh, actually it's on the Ferris...
 Well, this is where you're gonna get it...I hope. Just keep looking out there, pal.  SpongeBob to Sandy, SpongeBob to Sandy, come in, Sandy!
 No, no, B, Sandy! No, B!  Uh, Patrick, you know how sometimes you plan something special and things don't just work out?
 Patrick, here it is!
 It's a handshake...a friendly handshake.
 A friendly handshake. Happy Valentine's Day!
 Uh, no problem, Fran.
 You too, Dave.
  Patrick!
  Squidward!
 Squidward! Squidward, wait!
 You dropped this little piece of paper.
 I just figured you probably want it back.
 Garbage?! But, Squidward, in the right hands, this paper is a gold mine of entertainment. A spectacular afternoon of underwater fun. A treasure trove of...
 So you don't want it?
 Does that mean I can have it?
 You sure?
 So are you definitely, positively sure?
 But are you...
 Last chance to change your mind, Squidward.
 So, I take that as a possible no? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?  Okay, Squidward, that's a promise I'll just have to keep. Ah, Mr. Paper, I am so lucky to have a friend like Squidward.
 I'm sorry, Squidward, it's just...  ...it's just that I'm thinking of all the fun I'm going to have with this piece of paper!
 La, la, la, la, la. Gary, watch this!  Guess what I am.
 Well, yes, Gary, I am a sponge with paper stuck in his pants, but I'm also...  Super Sponge, soaking up crime. See, here's my cape.
 Now I'm...  SpongeBob JunglePants!
  Ah! It's raining Krabby Patties! Yeah!  A quick midnight snack and then it's back to bed.  Aww, sleep tight, my little angel.  Ah, here it is.  Nothing like a sea-nut butter and jellyfish jelly sandwich to get you to sleep.  The fridge!
  Oh, Gary, I don't feel like myself.
 Don't be silly, Gary. I don't get colds. I get the suds.
 No, Gary. If I had the suds, I'd have bubbles coming outta me.
 I can't get the suds,  because then I'll have to miss work!
 No, Gary. I like wearing my underwear like this.
 I'm not sick. I'm going to work.
  Right away, sir.
  Here's that patty you wanted, Mr. Krabs, sir.
 No, Mr. Krabs, I'm okay, honest.
 Oh, Gary, I feel horrible.  Oh, who am I kidding, Gary? I've got the suds, no doubt about it.  I'd better take care of this before it gets out of hand.
 Sandy, I'm sick.  Can you escort me to the doctor's?
 Yeah, okay, Sandy, thanks.  Coming.
 I'm sick, Patrick. I'm going to the doctor.
 Why not, Patrick?
  It can't be as horrible as the suds.
 Is that the horrible part, Patrick?
 No!
 No, no! No stethoscope, no doctor, no old magazines, no hiss! No!  Patrick, I don't want to go to the doctor.
 You gotta help me get better, Patrick. Please? Would you like to be my doctor, Patrick?
 I don't know.
 No bubbles! Patrick, your treatment is working!
 Sure! At this rate, I'll be cured in no time. In fact, I'm going to call Sandy and tell her not to come. Thanks, Dr. Patrick!
  My fingers are too big for the buttons.  Dr. Patrick, will you call Sandy for me?
 Uh-uh.
  Not really.
 I don't...think so.
 No.
 Nope.
 Uh-uh.
 Hiya, Sandy.
 Ahh...
 I'm okay, Sandy, really.
 I'm better, guys! Really!
 Guys!
 I can't stop now!  Help me!
 Mr. Krabs!
  You're not going to make me read old magazines, are you?
 Whoo! Yeah! Whoo!  This tickles!  I can smell again!  Whoo! Yeah! Yeah-eah! Whoo! Yeah!  I feel as good as new! I love the doctor!
 Huh? Who's there?
 Okay, Mr. Krabs, the dishes are done, I'm leaving!
 No thank you, Mr. Krabs. Uhh, does it have monsters in it?
 Uhh... no.  Is it a true story?
 Okay, maybe just a little.
 Excuse me, did his ship look like a Krabby Patty?
 Do souls look like pickles?
 Humph, Squidward!
 The name's SquarePants. It's SquarePants!  I don't get it, Gary. Every Halloween, no matter how hard I try, everybody scares me.
  Well, I'm sick of it.  No more ScaredyPants!
 Gary, it's Patrick! I'm going to scare him! It's my turn.  Rawr!
 Why can't I be frightening for once? Where's my chance?
 What do you think?
 No, no! I'm the ghost of the Flying Dutchman!
 I don't know, Patrick.
  Rawr-rawr!
 Okay, okay, here's your candy.
 I don't get it, Patrick.
 That is it, Patrick!
 What's the difference between that ghost and me?
 I have a square head and a real ghost has a round one. All we have to do is make my head round and boo, I'm scary!
  Remember, like this.
 Shave me down, make me round!
 What do you think?
 Oooh... I'm the Flying Dutchman!
 Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman!
 Do you think?
 Who should we scare next?
 Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman!
  Exercise time is over, Gary.  We don't want you getting too thin.  Here, boy. Fetch!
 Huh?   Good job, Gary!  I love you, Gary!  Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary!  Ha, ha! Down, boy! Ha ha!
 For what?
 That was this weekend?  I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!
 Good morning, Squidward! Wanna go jellyfishing?  Great! We'll be right over!
 Ready to go?
 No, Patrick, he's just not ready.  Ready now?
 How about now?
 Now?
 Now?
 How about now?
 Now?
 Now?
 Now?
 Now?
 Ready yet?
 Sure we do.
 Ready?
 I'd love to be at work today! But it's Sunday; the Krusty Krab is closed.
 Well, he's not here. I'll bet that eager-beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields!
 Ah, time for bed, Gary.
 Oh, Gary.  You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary.  Hey! Over here!  Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license!  Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it!  I sure take a good picture.  Darn! I should have grown a mustache.  How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt.  Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here.  Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!
 No!  Ouch! Where am I?  Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
  This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look.  Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is.  Gary! Huh?  Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...?
 Gary?
 Gary! You can talk!
 What does that mean?
 Who?
  Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.
 Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now.
  I wonder what Patrick's dreaming.  I can't resist!  Hey, Patrick!
  You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
 I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper.  Going up! Eh?  I can make...  A million of me! Eh? Eh?
 Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream.
 Ooh, this is gonna be good!  Psst! Squidward!  Hey, Squidward!
  Squidward!  Huh? Huh?
 Trust me, Squidward.
  La la! La la la la la la la!
 Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
 Do you know what today is?
  No, silly!  That's on the 15th!  Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month.
 What do you mean?
 That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too, if you tried harder.
 Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile.
 Huh?
 Nooo!  How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?!
 Making...Krabby Patties?
  Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!
 That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...
 No, Squidward!
 An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.
 What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?!
 But, sir…
 Crystal, sir!
 I won't let Squidward win!  He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited.
 You can't win that award if you don't get up for work!
  That can be arranged.
 Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row.
 I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow.
 Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!
 Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!
 Well, me neither! …26-time loser!  Look at him. Watchin' me.
 Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh?
 Nope!  Nighty Night.
 Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?
 All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work!
 Now to get some rest. Don't want to look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo!  Squidward!
 Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty!  Ow! Squidward!
 Truce.
 You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it.
 And may the better man win.  He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!
  As soon as he stops shaking my hand...
 Hike, Patrick, hike!  You just lost three points.  One. Two. Five!  G-7!
 But it's not Tuesday, Patrick.
 Now what?
  Okay... ready!
 I got it! I got it!  I got it! I got it! I got it!  Remember, Patrick, finders keepers.
 Uhh, Patrick? I think something's wrong with Squidward. He looks unconscious.
 Get off him, Patrick!
 But he still feels cold.
 Do you think he'll be okay?
 I don't know.
 No, no, that part goes here.
 We're almost there. We can do this.
 This is working.  Patrick, this isn't working!
 I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's... He's... He's pushing up daisies!
 No, stay back!
 It was an accident!
 Please, Mr. Squidward's ghost!  Spare us your ghostly anger!
 We'll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us!
 Does that include...
 Here?
 Here?
 Here?
 Too tired...
 Only the freshest, o spooky one.  A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness.  A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness.
 Art thou not pleased?
 Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it.
 Flank steak.
 But this is just a piece of tissue paper.
 I can't do it!
 Patrick, are you ready for this?
 Okay, let's go. Patrick, are you coming?
 Patrick, it's this way.
 Here.
 It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off!
 Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman.  It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?
 No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest.
 Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony.
 We're going to put you to rest.
 Yeah.
 Okay, get in.
 But you said we could put you to rest.
 A-ha!  Hey!  Okay, that's far enough! Huh?  Tartar sauce!
 Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and...  Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true.
 Plankton! It's you!
 Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.
 I said, you're a--
 Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy!  Wow!
 What is it?
  Wow, what are you gonna do with it?
 The moon! Can I go?
 But I don't take up that much space!  See?  I can fit in here.  Mmm, cozy.
 Well, how about...  This?  Or this?  Or this?
 Fine.  Put me in the brig, I don't mind!
 Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?
  Yeah! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride! Moon ride! Moon ride!
 Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?
 Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting.
 Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores?  And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night?  Ah! There's one now!
  Oh, hurry up!  These oughta do the trick.
 What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here?
 A present?
 There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy.
 Alien repellent? Let me see that.  New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows!
 It's pretty impressive, all right.
 We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!
 We don't, we're just spraying the...  ...windows.
 Yeah, just don't touch anything.
 Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun...  ...house?
 Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?
 Patrick, I don't think we should...
 No more!  Okay, one more.  Okay, that's enough. Let's go.
 Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here and I happen to know that that particular button is right over here.
 Look!  We're in space now! Wee!
 Hey! You got your toothpaste in my peanut butter!  Patrick, I can do this!
 We must be landing.
 Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick.
 Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it!  Yeah!
 Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me!  Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier!
 Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them! Uh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee, Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to.  Make sure your gun is pumped.  Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting.  It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis.
 Patrick, do you know what this thing is?
 No, it's an egg sack! Let's look at the embryo.
 Let's capture the little phony!
 We don't want your money, moon man!  Look at them squirming around in there.
 Well, there's plenty more where those came from.
 There's no time for that! Just push harder.
 Nice try, Sandy.
 It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone.  So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!
 Yeah? Well, I got you now.
 Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face when she sees this!  Sandy, I'm back!  Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different.  Uh-oh...
  Oh, uhh, Mr. Krabs, can I get my paycheck?
 Uhh, sir, I can't see you. The boots  are in  the way.
 Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots.
 Who's that?
 ♪I'm ready! I'm ready! I want those boots!♪
 Hmmm.. I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck?
 And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?
 And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders!
 And...
 Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!
 I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First, I have to make my speech.
 Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.
 And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties...  ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall!  Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time.  "Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears."  In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform  and assume my duties as...  ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff!  Oh, and I will be re...
 I overdid the speech again, didn't I?
 Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this.  I hardly knew ya.
 Yes, Mrs. Puff?
 A-hoo!  Thanks, Mrs. Puff!
 Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor!  What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?
 On patrol. I'm on patrol.  Uh-oh, an open window.
 The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example.  I'm the open window maniac!  I hope you learned a valuable lesson!  On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol...  Vandals! Another crime.  hmm...strawberry! I must act!  Patrick...  Patrick... Patrick...
 Patrick! Down here!
 Patrick. Come down here.
 I'm down here.
 That's hall monitor to you!
 Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in.
  "Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
 Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority.  Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?
 Okay, now what?
 This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies!  And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run ‘em out!
 One cryin' Johnny comin' up! First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up!
  Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up!
 I got it already, Squidward.  Bubble Bass.
  Yep. I hear talk you're kinda picky.
 Well then... here ya go!  Well, Bubble Bass, whaddaya think?
 No!
  But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on!  Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles?
 Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty.
 Wait! Wait! Wait!
 Okay, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let's see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then pickles? No! That's not right!  Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the pickles? No!  Mustard down, bun stuff down, d'oh, where's the patty go?  Pickles, ketchup, wait! Think! Think! I'm losin' it!  Bun down, shoe, mustard, pan, bun... no!  Mr. Krabs, I am so confused. I can't remember how to do anything.
 Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?
 Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup...  The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing!  Oh.  Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better go on home and rest my brain.  Uhh, which way do I live?  Of course.  No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomatoes, pickles, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No. Shoe?  I am so confused! Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get my head on straight.
 Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or...  D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow.  Good night, Gary.
 Aw, this isn't right.  Good night, Gary.
 Wait, this isn't right either.  Nope.  Nuh-uh.  Negative.  C'mon, c'mon! Get it right.  Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet!  Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!
 Gary!
  Come on, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot.
 Safety first.  A-ha! I finally gotcha!  Ah, there is nothing better than the taste of natural jelly from a jellyfish. See you later!  Oh, oh my glasses! Thanks, little guy! Bye!  I can't play anymore, jellyfish. I got to get home.  No. You can't go home with me.  Jellyfish, you've got to stay here! Hey!  Stay!  Stay...  [exasperated] Jellyfish! For the last time, you cannot come home with me!  Ahh, what the heck!  Squidward! Hey, Squidward! Squidward! Squidwardiard!  Squidward! Look at my new pet!
 No he isn't! Watch this! Fetch!  How many fingers am I holding up?  Play dead!
 Well, we're going to my house to have a little fun.
  Whew! Wow, you sure like to dance. Well, that's enough for tonight. It's time to go to bed.  Huh?  You got it all wrong, little fella.  Bed. Repeat after me.  Bed!  We'll just keep you right here.
 Quit worrying, Gary. He'll be just fine. Good night, everybody.
 Good morning, Gary. Good morning, jellyfish. Jellyfish? Jellyfish? Here, jellyfish. Oh, jelly!
  Oh, jellyfi-!  Where'd you all come from?  Okay, that's it. Party is over! You guys have overstayed your welcome.  This music is way too loud.  Very funny.  I'm serious!
 Come on, guys, enough is enough!  Uh-oh! Hey, take it easy! Ow! Okay, I'll talk to him!  Squidward! Would it be possible to play your clarinet a little... better? I don't think the jellyfish like it.
 Okay, he said he'll play better.  Uh-oh! That's not better!  Hey! Take it easy with that!  Those are my things!  Don't break th- Dow!
 Hey, now, that wasn't nice!  Okay, that is it! Everybody out!  Come on, Gary!  Gary, you were right. Thanks for not rubbing it in.  Huh? They stopped?  Gary! Don't... stop... shaking it!
 Hooray, Gary! We're finally huge!
 Huh? Wait a minute! Oh no!
 Shellphone! I know, I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do!
 Squidward!
  Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking and I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and smaller...  Oh no!
 Ohh... nematodes.  The only thing left of my house is this little pebble.
 I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone! It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live?
 I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad.
 We can't build a house!
 Alright, Patrick, lets get to work!
 Yeah! So what do you think?
 Really?
 One bedroom.
  Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop.
 That'd be great!
 Good night, rockmate.
 Good night, Gary.  Oh...what the...?
 No, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick! Wake up! Wake up! It's me, SpongeBob!
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
  Squidward? Squidward?
 Squidward?
 Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?
 Thanks. Thanks, Squidward.  Squidward, could you scoot over a little?
 While you're at it, could you get me a glass of water?
 Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here.  Thanks, buddy.
 Yeah, I like sleepovers.
 Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward.
 Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you.
 Here come my parents.
 Hi, Mom.
 Just give me a minute.  I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble.  You hold too many memories.  Well, Squidward, this is goodbye.
 Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom.
 My house is back!  Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be!  Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever!
  Ahh, what a wonderful day. The sun is out, the water is shimmering, scallops are chirping. So peaceful.
 Oh, sure thing, Squidward.
 Okay.
 Hey, Squidward. Wanna blow some bubbles? Only 25 cents.
 Uh huh.
 Good morning to you, sir. Would you care to blow a bubble?
 Only a quarter.
 Sure thing, Patrick.
 Thank you.
 One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go.  Could I interest you in some lessons? Only 25 cents.
 Okay, Patrick, it's all in the technique.  First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then...
 And now... with two hands!
 Excuse me, sir, but we are clo-
 We're not just blowing bubbles. We're making bubble art. Watch carefully.  First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then...
 That'll be 25 cents, sir.
 We also offer lessons for beginners.
 Hey, Squidward, remember the technique.  Squidward, technique! You do this, and this, step back....
 Spin around like thi— Like this...  Look at me, over here, one... two.... yeah, three...
 Look, we're doing the technique! And don't for... Don't forget the "Woooooo!" Squidward?
 Technique! Technique! Technique!
  You're not doing the technique.
 All right, Squid. That was so good.
 No.
 You said it, Squidward. See, it is all in the technique.
  Squidward!
  Wow, four stingers.  Where have I seen this before? Field Guide Here it is.  Land squirrel.  That little squirrel is in trouble.
 Hooray, land squirrel!  Look out!  Hold on, little squirrel!  You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai!  Hey, I'm actually doing it.  Your shell is mine!
 Yup, and just relax.
 Oooh! Oooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?
 A flower.
 They sure do.
 Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?
 Yeah.
 That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest.
 I thought that meant you were nuts.
  Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby, and if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength!  What do you think about that, "Miss Mittens"?
 Ahh!  Hey, no fair, Sandy! You got a head start!
 Hey!  You did that on purpose!
  Aaaaah!
  I didn't!
  I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!
 I can underwater! I'm...  Hydrodynamically designed!  Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?
 I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there!  -halfway there!-halfway there!
  There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature  waiting!
 I did! And I took a head start like you did!
 I guess I don't, air breather!
 Tree climber!
 Kite flier!
  Take that back! You-  not wet person!
 Proves what?
 ManSponge...
 Oh my gosh, Patrick. This is the greatest wall of superhero super gadgetry ever! I'm going to play with the Cosmic-Ray!
 What about the Orb of Confusion?
 Come Boy Patrick. While our heroes are away, we will keep evil at bay.
 What is it, trusted sidekick?
 Looks like he's frozen or something.
 It appears to be some sort of prison chamber...  ...made out of frozen tartar sauce. This is incredible. Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil Man Ray is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him.  Pat, what are you doing? We're not supposed to touch anything!
 We could get in trouble.
 He said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain!
 Uh, actually, Mr. uh... Man Ray, sir, only your head is free.
 Well, uhh, Mr. Evil Man Ray, sir, we can't do that.
 Because you're evil!
 Yeah, sure, why not?
 Really?
 Really, really?
 Really, really, really?
 Well, that's good enough for me.
 Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode #17.
 Oh, me too, me too.
 Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle...
 We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go.
 Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready first day at goodness school?  Pat, get your wallet out.  Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet.  Now, what do you do?
 No. Wrong.  Good people don't rip other people's arms off  Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggling with a heavy package. What do you do?
 Alright, goodness lesson number three.  Uhh, let's see.
 Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good.
 Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad.
 No, you let go!
 Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word.
 No. Please.
 Rehabilitated.
 It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future.  Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness.  Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff.  We're not supposed to touch that, either.  We are really not suppose to touch those, sir.  Good people have no use for weapons such as...  thoooose!
 That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat.
 Forget about your skin, Patrick. Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him. This is a job for Mermaid Man...
 To the Invisible Boatmobile!
 Wait! I don't have a license.
 You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle Boy.
 Not so fast, arch-villain. We still have the Orb of Confusion.  Take this!  Doy. Duh.
  I am raking the leaves.
 Sandy, I can't rake any faster.  These are big leaves.  And they keep breaking into more leaves.
 What's the big rush anyway, Sandy?
 Hibernating? What's that?
 Can I do that?
 Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male.
 Why, Sandy? When does your... "carburation" begin?
 But Sandy, that only gives us 1, 2, 3...  168 more hours of playtime!
 Climb!
 Jump!
 Ride!
 Wait, Sandy!
 Sandy?
 Sandy, I'm willing to sacrifice any of my time that I haven't already sold to Mr. Krabs to you.
 Life's as extreme as you want to make it!  Whoo!
 Yeah.  Whew, what a workout.  I'm going to be feeling this tomorrow.  Ow.
 Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again.  Good night, Gary.
  W-what h-happened to s-sleeping?
 Yeah! I've never played extreme jacks before!
 Sandy, are you sure we're supposed to be standing up here?
 Gee, that sounds safe! I mean, fun.  Okay, I'm ready! I thought you said we were riding through the park, Sandy!
  This squirrel's trying to kill me! Any more of these stunts and I'll be reduced to a puddle!  Wait a minute, I've got to talk my way out of this! Sandy, I think I need to tell you something.
 Well, it's just that I'm feeling sort of...  I just feel like maybe I need to...
 Not yet.
 You do that.
 Gotta hide! Uh-G-Gotta hide!  Home? No. Gary can't keep a secret.  Under a rock? It's so original!
 Gee, Patrick, I didn't know you spoke bird.
 This whole sack?
 Uh sorry, I don't speak Italian.
 What's that lump in its belly?
  Wait! You forgot about this pet!
 Look at him Patrick, isn't he great? Hey, little fella.
 Aw look, isn't he just precious? Let's take him out to play.  998, 999, 1, 000. Ready or not, here I come!
 I know, Patrick, days like today only come once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Savor every moment. And it's all thanks to Wormy. I made this for Wormy.  Our new best friend.  Until tomorrow, new best friend. Don't be sad, little buddy. We'll be back first thing in the morning for frolic and fun.
 Aw, don't be sad, Patrick. [cut to Bikini Atoll] It's only until tomorrow.
 Eww.  What's happening to me?
  I'm off to work at the Krusty Krab, frying up patties and bladdity blab!  Huh? That's new. Strange place to park a car. What’s this for?
 Carbon dioxide?
 Why do you want an endless summer, Mr. Krabs?
 Here are the colorful boats that travel the canals in Xochimilco.
 No, Patrick, I said, "Xochimilco," not...  We learned that in Mexico, instead of Halloween, they celebrate día de los Muertos.
 Uh, but, Patrick, you are Patrick.
 I think not. You, sir are Orin J. Ruffy.
 Huh.
 Hey everybody! It's time to dance!
 Do the cyclops!
 Now, do the sea monster!
 Patrick, are you okay?
  Patrick, with this time machine we can go back to the past and make our young selves wiser.
 Gadzooks!!!
 Well, Patrick, I'm glad you asked that question.  ♪I would give free Krabby Patties, to the whoole darn town.♪
 ♪And if I saw a frown, "Aha!" I'd turn it upside down!♪  ♪And as for toxic waste, I don't care for the taste.♪
  ♪So listen to my skeem. I'd change it into ice creeeam!♪
 And that's what I would do. What would you do, Patrick?
 Hi, Patrick, what are you reading?
 Hey, Patrick?
  Oh, hello. Welcome to the Bikini Bottom Jellyfish Trauma Center. Let's go inside.  Ow!
  These poor souls are here because they found themselves for the wrong side of a jellyfish stinger. Not if they're the right side.  The point is, that we will all be respectful...
 Bah! Stepped on a pickle.
 Ow, that pickle's Plankton. What happened to you?
 Aw, you poor thing, have some flowers.
 Nurse! This hot dog needs help!
 Patrick, what are you doing here?
 I think we've all learned something here for today. Thanks for watching.
 Jellyfishing Safety Tips. Rule number one: never to feed the jellyfish while jellyfishing.
 Rule number two: never, ever try to capture a baby jellyfish.
  Which leads us to our final rule, always carry a thick tube of emergency Jellyfishing Sting Ointment.
 Help me pick out an outfit for the party, Gary Bear.
 Too much, huh?
 Too little? Yeah, little bit drafty, too.
 Oh, Gary. You are a real stickler for authenticity.  Ta-dah!
 You're right, Gary. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
 The Story of  King Neptune.  When King Neptune was a little Neptune, his mother sent him adrift in a river. As he floated along, a giant meteor fell on Earth. An alien appeared, and inflicted the baby with Super Neptune Fluid.  By the time he was in school, he had already begun exhibiting signs of super-duperness. As an adult, he would fly through the sea, helping people, and getting snails off of sea-trees.
 Sure.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 I know who took your money.
  It was me, Mr. Krabs! Please don't tear me into a thousand little pieces and mesh me back together and tear me to pieces again!
 To clean and polish it.
  Morning!
 SpongeBob SquarePants at your service, for I am an honorary crossing guard.
 You're safe with me.
 We'll see about that!
 You're wel...  welcome.
 I almost forgot. It's "Surprise Sandy Day."  The only question is how to surprise her.
  Ahh! The wonders of modern-day technology!  What astonishing and distractionable adventures will you lead me on today! Okay SpongeBob, you've got to figure out about the times! You have got to figure out...  Snapper Chat!
 Umm...  I guess I'll take a picture of this...  ...now!
  At first, we didn't know what to do with all the money.
 Twelve bubbles blowing!
 Are you okay, Gary?
 What we gonna do?
 Whoops.  Sorry, Bubble Bass.
 Okay, Patrick, up with the loveseat.
 But don't you have to pack your things before we can move 'em?
   Oh, Patrick
 Okay, Patrick, let's get p-p-p-packing!
 Oh...
 Whew, I hope we didn't leave anything behind.
 Oh pardon us, ma'am, but could you walk around?
 Back it up?  Okay. Back it up, Patrick.
  Oh, oh, oh!
 Phew, hey, Patrick, from now on, we gotta be more careful. Huh? Patrick...
 Oh, focus, Patrick, focus!
 Ah, that's perfect.
  I'm down here.
 We shall, Patrick
 Hmm...Hm?  Hey, this is the address! We made it, Patrick! Nice aim, babies!
  Focus! Let's get all this stuff inside the house, then we can eat. Hmm, hmm.
 Oh, Bubble Bass, special delivery.  Hmm? Okay, Patrick, push it!
  Uh-oh, Patrick. Look what we did to Bubble Bass's granny's house.
 Well, that's a relief. For a minute there, I thought we did something wrong.
  Don't look down, Patrick!
  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh!  Uh-oh, Patrick, I think I have the—   Hiccups.
  Here comes another one, Patrick.
 Thanks, buddy. We're almost there. Just a few more steps, and we'll claim that free lunch.
 Well, this is a dilly of a pickle.
 Oh, your goods are all good, Bubble Bass. And we sure build up an appetite for that free lunch.
 That was the meanest thing I ever saw, Bubble Bass. You, sir, have crossed the line of aquatic decency. You might think you took a couple of bottom feeders like us for a ride today, but I got a newsflash for you, slappy. These bottom feeders wouldn't eat your free lunch if you paid us.
 Come, Patrick. I'll make you a free Krabby Patty for $2.50 plus tax.
 Founders Day is here today, Squidward is this even?
  Wow, Mr. Krabs really loves Founder's Day!
 But just look at him go!
 Well it's not just that, Mr. Krabs has a lot of love in his heart for this town.
 Hey at least we have Founders Day!
 Tummies! Ha-ha-ha
  Ready for work!  Good morning, Squidward, I...   Not ready for work!
  Thanks for waiting, Squidward.
  I was in such a hurry, I almost forgot my pants.
 I guess I was in a panic, I mean I can't believe we're running so late for work, and you, huh, Squidward, can you believe it, are you panicking too? Late for work, late for work, we're running late for work, right?
 I know, only fifteen minutes early? Maybe we should take a shortcut!  Squidward, what are you doing?!
 I don't follow.
 Speak English, brainiac!
  Mmm, strawberry!
 Sorry, Squidward. I just never seen a séance before.
 Just leave it to me, old rusty one! Prepare for a... What the barnacles is a Rusty on Rye?  Let's see... R... R... R... Ramblin Ham, Red Herring, Rib Tickler, Rusty Penguin, Salty Steamer. Huh, guess I don't know how to make Rusty on Rye.  But I can certainly learn! Help me out, sir. Can you clue me in on what was on your beloved Rusty on Rye?
  No!  Mr. Krabs! There was an unsatisfied customer! Why don't we serve the Rusty on Rye anymore?
 Ooh.
 I believe I've seen a program on this matter!
 I may be able to get that recipe after all. I just need to call in a favor.  Hi Patrick! SpongeBob here.  Yeah, the one with square pants. Mm-hmm. Hey, listen, can you meet me after work? I need your help with something.  Your best friend SpongeBob SquarePants.
  I got it.
  Nothing.
  Going to work, going to work, I'm going to work! I'm going to work, I'm going to work  I'm going to work!  I'm going to work. I'm going to work, going to work, go-going to work. I'm crossing the street!  I'm crossing the street! Cross- whup!  I'd recognize that sound anywhere! It's the sound of horrible, croaking sobbing!
 Plankton?
 Plankton, what's got you so upset? I can hear you from three blocks away!
 Doomsday device? What's it supposed to do?
 So, what does it do instead?
 Sparks and falls apart?
  N-no!  I believe you! I uh...  ...believe you.
 Well, look on the bright side, Plankton. If all your hopes and dreams finally came true, then you wouldn't have anything left to look forward to.
 Plankton, wait! Wait! Wait!
 Maybe what you need is to join a club or something. Meet new people. You know, make some friends.
 Um, something like that.
 Well, usually when I'm trying to find something, I just look it up in the phone book. 
 Man Ray? But he's one of Bikini Bottom's most notorious super villains! Arch nemesis of fame television super heroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.  He's in the phone book?  Plankton, you were looking under  not 
  Mr. Krabs! You said to hold onto your glasses! When all I could find were these extra large milkshake cups!  Do these count?
 Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Emergency Search Light? What for?
 Aye aye, captain! 
  Where is it? Where is it? That search light could be anywhere up here! Oop! There!  Yes! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy will be here in no time!  Hmm. I guess this is only good for nighttime emergencies.  HELP! HELP! Must-find-Mermaid-Man-Barnacle-Boy! Man-Ray-Krusty-Krab-taking-over! 
 A little more sand. Pat, Pat, Pat. Pat, Pat, Patrick! Check it out. An exact replica of the Krusty Krab. One sandy patty. Extra grit.
 ♪Mop, mop, mop, mop, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping, mopping mopping!♪
 Sure thing.
  Perfection.
 But, Mr. Krabs I...
 Really?
 Yes, I had a cup of sea kelp and a Neptune muffin.
 I did go to bed 2 minutes later than usual.
 An insomni-wha?
 Oh, but sir, I can't miss work at the Krusty Krab.
 No Krusty Krab?
  Yes, sir.
 I just don't get it Gary, I don't usually have a problem sleeping, do I?
 Well I am not going to allow a mistake like today's to happen again. I am going straight to bed! [Cut to SpongeBob's bed.
 This pillow is hard as a rock! What to do?
 You're right Gary! Warm milk puts me right to sleep! Now, that should do the trick!
  Boy, it sure is quiet around here. Only 5 hours until I go to work. C'mon SpongeBob, you can do this. 4 hours 59 minutes 50 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 45 seconds, 4 hours 59 minutes 41 seconds!  What if I don't get to sleep at all?  Ohhh, Mr. Krabs was right!  I am an insomniac. What am I gonna do? (speaking) I need some help.  Patrick, Patrick, wake up.
 Oh, yuck! Never mind that Patrick! I need your help! Desperately! I'm a insomniac! I need to sleep!
 Oh boy! A bedtime story!
 Ah, yay!
 Mm, sounds like me.
 Slumber!
 Aw, thank you Sir Cecil.
 Patrick, what are you doing? And what kind of a bedtime story was that, anyway?
 Patrick, I'm trying to go to sleep.
 Um, Patrick, that's...
 Patrick, this isn't...
 That's a catchy bit...
 That's an excellent number, but...
  Patrick! This isn't helping either!
 Oh, barnacles.
 Patrick, get serious please!
 I really appreciate your efforts, but I gotta try something else, buddy. 'Kay?
 Blech!
 Okay... Patrick, How is this gonna-
 Hey, That wasn't too bad. What was it?
 C-C-C-C-C-Coffee? Oh, for the last time, Patrick, I'm trying to !
 Uh oh.. feeling jittery, heart p-p-pounding, teeth grinding...  Uh oh.  N-no! No stop! We gotta get to sleep. Well, I guess I'll just have to let my legs tire out and catch up with my weary brain.
 Ahh! Sea troll! Huh? Just a shrub. Keep going till you crash SpongeBob.
 I'm sorry Mr. warm milk, you just tasted so good.  Shoo! That billboard is definitely not talking to you.
 The Krusty Krab is stowed and ready to slumber.
 Push-a-what?
 Uh, I'm not following you.
 Oh, you mean your obsession.
  You called Mr. Krabs?
  Yes! Please!
 To see her vacation slides for the hu..  Ow!
  Boy, I can't wait to show Sandy my new karate moves,  oh, Sandy, aaah...  Sandy is in trouble. Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming to save you!
 Whoa...what was that stench?
  You know kah-ra-tay?
 But, Sandy, you already have a black belt.
 Gee...I wish I had a karate belt
 Okay? How do I do that?
 Hm?
 Um...sorry. I'm confused.
 But how can anyone ever truly know whether he or she is worthy?
 Uhh, Patrick gobbles down the patties. Nom nom nom nom nom.
 Well, cause you're the mascot.
 Oh, I know! Win a date with Squidward Tuesday!
 Mr. Krabs doesn't think my ideas are helping.
 I just want to help him find the perfect Krabby Patty gimmic.
 Great idea, Squidward!
  Ohh, what is this?
 Uhh, I can explain. That partially eaten Krabby Patty isn't just garbage, it's a work of art. It's worth a fortune.
 So you see why Mr. Krabs is trying to get it back.
 Plankton, you've stolen a priceless work of art. There's only one thing you can do.
 No, you need to turn yourself in.
 Who's that?
 What?
 Really?
 Now you've gone too far!
 I can't believe you're calling me that!
 Patrick, what are you eating?
 Now Patrick is harboring stolen merchandise in his belly!
  Mr. Krabs, I think I have the solution.
 My pleasure, sir. And I think Patrick likes it too.
 Spring cleaning! Guess what time of year it is, Gary?
 Thanks for your help, Gare!
 Hi, Patrick. How's your spring cleaning going?
 Hey, buddy, what are you cleaning for?
 Who's that?
 Wow, I didn't know you had a sister!
 Gee, I'm sorry, Patrick.
 It's gonna be okay... you're gonna see her again... today... right... today? Come on... cheer up, buddy. Hey, I'll make sure her visit here will be extra super special, no matter what!
 Yeah, Patrick and I go back a long way.  Yeah long way, heh heh, go back.
 No, no, don't be upset with Squidward. He doesn't mean it, don't you, Squidward?
  Oh, Squidward, you jokester.
 Easy now, gents, let's not let tempers flare. Now don't you think, Patrick, it's a teensie bit unfair that sister Sam dismantled Squidward's house?
 It's not like that at all, Patrick. I was just-
 Squidward... wait, Squidward, w-wait! Before you do anything too rash, let me try to talk to them.
 I don't think you should do that.
 Now, Sam, it's not what it seems. Squidward was just rearranging the spiffy.
 Please don't.
 Well, Squidward, at least on the bright side it will motivate you to finally take care of that kitchen remodeled. Right, Squidward?  Huh? Must be getting started.
  Squidward, Squidward stop!  Just calm down, buddy. Let's ease that tentacle off of the accelerator, hmmm?
 Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control.
 She destroyed my house in a fit of rage! She needs to control her temper!
 Patrick?
 Hit it one more time Patrick. Don't want anyone stealing it.  Perfect
 Good Job Patrick.
 We were just posting Patrick's new "For Rent" sign. Did we work on it all morning, see?
  No, Patrick here is just gonna rent out his front yard.
 Oh Squidward, that reminds me. Patrick and I are off to Jellyfish Fields for the day. We were wondering if maybe you can stick around and keep an eye out for any takers.
 Oh, thanks!
 Aww, why not?
 Oh, well thanks anyway, Squidward.
 Do you know what that means?
 Great idea.
 Yeah. Our new neighbor must be really shy.
 Yeah, besides, we have more pressing things to attend to—like this jellyfish we've befriended and this brand new bottle of bubbles!
 Yeah.
  Ooh...delicious!
 Hi, Patrick!
 SpongeBob.
 With pleasure, Mr. Krabs.  I love this part of the job.
 And this part ain't bad either!
  You don't mean...
  Thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you. It is both an honor and a privilege that I shall---
 As I don the ceremonial white gloves, I can continue the eternal cycle and now deem the Krusty Krab...open.  Patrons, spring forth.  The Krusty Krab will now seat you.
  No need to shout Mr. Krabs, he's right here, secretly watching his favorite soap, "As The Tide Turns."
 You want me to go undercover?
 Understood, Mr. Krabs.  How do you like my new armpit spy cam, huh? Huh?
 Oh, and check this out—a special spy pen! Looks just like a regular pen, right? See? See? See? See? See? See? Just a pen, right? See?
 Well, you'd be mistaken, sir, because this pen is also...a pencil. Hmm? Pretty sweet undercover spy stuff, huh, Mr. Krabs?
 You're right, sir. Who needs a spy pen when you are a master in the undercover arts? I blend in with the common man. Then, like a whisper, I am gone.  Yellow Scrubber to Big Red. Come in, Big Red.
 I am inside. I repeat, I am inside. Nothing of interest to report so far. In fact, it's kind of dumpy. And customer safety... a little lax.  And it smells in here like a tuna bathed in algae after running a marathon.
 I have infiltrated the line right now, and I'll report back once I obtained sample.
 One of your finest sandwiches, please.
  "Headbands equal no service." Barnacles! My disguise's only weakness.  Whoa! Mayday, Big Red. Contact has not been established. Mission abort. Mission abort!  Yellow Scrubber to Big Red, I was not able to obtain any intel.

If there's anything I can do to return the favor, anything at all... you just let me know. Anyway, back to my Karate exercises.  Oh, and help yourself to the cheese bucket. Thanks again, buddy. HIYA!
  What, what, you mean karate?
 Oh, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick... my dear, dear friend. Karate is a delicate art, a skill that takes years to...
 Yeah... However...
 Well, I did say that, Patrick, but, well, karate is about finesse, not so much brute strength. You see, there's so much you don't know. You have not even scratched the surface of the surface.
 As you wish, just remember one thing. With power, comes responsibility.
 Okay. Let’s start off simple. This is a basic move called "the inverted whirlpool".
 Think you can handle that?
 Now, this is very easy, watch closely.  Haa-haah. You got it?
 Patrick, I didn't want to have to say this... but you're... you're unteachable.
  Look what you did to this wall of cinder blocks. In all my years of training, I've never seen a perfect slice. No ones ever been able to execute such a clean karate chop through a wall of cinder!
 You're a natural! A karate genius!
  Now let's put your new skills to the test. This is sharpened, tempered steel. Now don't be frustrated if it takes a few tri- . Wow. Amazing!
 This is an abandoned, broad-ironed steamboat, solid as a rock. Think you got what it takes?
 Ahhh... better luck next time.
  Noooooo! What did I tell you?!
 Not that!  ...this. : With power... comes responsibility. That means no chopping of any life from or their property. You understand?
 Good!  Oh man, I'm late for work.  See you later, buddy. Don't forget what I said.
 Hey, look, it's Patrick!
 What are you doing...
  Dear Neptune!
 Patrick, don't you think you're taking your perfect slice a bit too far?
 But, but, but-
 Oooohhh!
  I'm sorry, Gary. I thought you were done....  Wow. This town is sure going downhill.  Uh, Mr. Krabs. What are you doing out here?
 I don't know, but when he does that he usually finds change.
 Yeah. Watch.
 You mean snail.
 You said pets were not nothing but disease-carrying vermins that should never be brought to the workplace.
 But the whole process causes Gary big discomfort. I could never do it to him.
  Patrick, wow!
 You are the best starer I’ve ever stared at!
  Hark, Patrick. Do you hear something?  Oh!  Hmm, it’s a letter for Sandy, all the way from Texas. We better deliver it!
  Hmm... I'd say a hydrated explosive.

 It's an ad.  Dear Comic Book Reader.
  Have you ever thought about turning one of your poems into a hit song on the radio?
  Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit!  Can we go now? My arms are getting tired.
 You can't always trust ads in comic books. Those X-Ray specs I ordered couldn't see through people's skin at all!  Only their clothes! Plus, you don't have $100.  Patrick, could you get my wallet?
 Hey, that's my comic book money!
 Patrick.
 No.  Ow! Can I have my arms back?
 Good luck.  Coming--
 You have to think of the words yourself.
  Oh, Patrick!
 Why would I hit you with a dodgeball?
  No!
  You can play your records later, Gary. Patrick, is that why you've been having trouble writing?
 Oh, I don't even own a dodgeball. Do you, Gary?
 That's the spirit, Patrick! I'll open a window.
  Patrick, don't strain yourself.
 Come on, let's hear it!
 I don't see any dodgeballs here buddy. Just an artist and his work.
  Uh, Patrick?
  It's really loud!
  oh...hmm... how do I put this delicately-- That was the best song I ever heard!
 We need to get that song on the radio!
 Darn, I just got that arm back.
 Did you see the look on his face?
 I didn't know they could turn inside out like that. Now, how are we going to get your record on the radio?
 I got an idea!  We just have to play your record from the top of this antenna.
 Huh? Patrick--
 Well, it looks like Bikini Bottom is throwing a party. and you know what a party needs.
 Yes, that is important. But I was thinking about music! Turn it up, Patrick!
 Look at that, Patrick!
  That's not an angry mob, Patrick. It's your fan club!

  Oh, Patty, I can't let them eat you. Your beauty must be preserved.  Amazing.
 Great idea.
  Enjoy, sir.
 What's cooking there, Patty? Oh, are you kidding? I love crepes. Oh, Patty, when we're together, I feel like we're in our own little world like, like— nothing can hurt us.  Fire!  Fire! Fire!
 It's okay, Patty, the fire's gone. You're safe now.  Oh, I better, uh— get the doorbell.
 Sorry, Patrick.  I already made plans to go for a walk through Jellyfish Fields with Patty. As soon as the little lady dries her hair, we're heading out.
 Sorry, Sandy. No time for karate today. After our walk, I'm going for a rowboat ride with Patty. Just waiting for her to put on her makeup. You know how long it takes a Krabby Patty to get ready.
  Patty. Yeah, well, you two have fun with that.  Patty and I have to be on our way.

 Good day, sir.
 Oh, I just got gussied up for my special dinner date.
 She's rich in taste.
 There she is.
  Here we are, darling. The best eatery in town.
 Mr. Krabs, Squidward— allow me to introduce my date— Patty.
 This isn't a “piece-o-meat”, Mr. Krabs. She's Patty.  And we're on a special date tonight so you don't mind if we get the "manager's treatment," do you?
 Oh, really? Mr. Fiver says different.
  How about now?
 Grrrrrazie!  Here you go, my dear. A throne befitting a queen.  Oh, good evening, monsieur. What might we have on the menu at this fine establishment?
 Don't say such a thing, Squidward. Patty's just a little sick is all. Wight, Wubbie-Lubbie.
 Squidward, what are you doing with my beautiful patty?
  Stop it, Squidward! Maybe you can't see Patty's beauty. But to me, she's the most gorgeous creature in the sea.
 Patty, you no mind to that, wubbie-wubbie. I will always love you—  Yeah, what is that smell?  Patty?  What happened to you?
 Um, not quite, Mr. Krabs.
 I see now. I see what I must do.  Oh, Patty, my darling. Before I do this, I want you to know that I only do it out of love.
  Can I get a doggie bag with that?
  And then, the ugly mollusk ran all the way home...
 Glove World! Roller coaster. First in line.
 Excuse me, which way to the Fist O' Pain?
 In the name of amusement, no...!
  I don't want to ride the Fiery Fist O' Pain!
 No! Well, yeah. It's just that I had a bad dream last night.
 What was your dream about, Patrick?
 Wait for me, Patrick.  Whoo! Fiery Fist O' Pain, here we come.
 Boy, the Fist O' Pain sounds...
 Yeah, really fun.
 That sure looks like fun.
 No tickets. I must have left it at home.
 I guess we're not gonna be riding the Fist O' Pain today.
 Oh, barnacles!.  It sure was lucky we found our tickets.
 There it is. The line looks awfully long.
 Yeah, and then the Fist O' Pain will seem even cooler.
 Can you believe some people are afraid to ride roller coasters?
 I can't believe it, Patrick. It's Glovey Glove!  Get over there and I'll take your picture with him.  Get closer, Patrick.
 Come on, closer.  That's it, a little more. Now hold onto his thumb. Give me a big smile.
  I mean, The Mitten.
 Yeah. Let's ride it just to see how baby-fied it is.
 Well, the line looks a little bit shorter now. Can you believe that some people are scared of this ride?
  We've gone eight times.
 Bye.
 Hello, Larry.
 Oh, it's, uh...  very manly, Larry.
 Um, I have a confession to make. We haven't gone on the ride because I'm... hungry. I'm very hungry. Hungry, hungry!
 No thanks, Patrick. Um, you got ice cream in your eyebrows.
 Hurry back so we can go on the ride.
 Oh, delicious dairy treat, I don't know what to do.
 I know, but the ride is really scary.
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it!
 I have to tell you something too, Patrick.
  Warning! This ride may cause: Crying, screaming, projectile vomiting, amnesia, spine loss, embarrassing accidents, uncontrollable gas...
 Is that all?
 Well, this is it, Pat.
 On the Fiery Fist O' Pain.
 We made it.
 This is it, Patrick.
 We made it!
 We're not crybabies.
 Patrick, I have a confession to make. I was really scared about going on this ride.
 I didn't know how to tell you because, well, I didn't want to disappoint you.
 But now we don't have to face our fears. The ride is broken.
 Patrick, I don't want to face my fears. I'm afraid of them!  Goodbye, Patrick.
 We conquered our fears!
 We survived the Fist o' Pain!
 Let's go again!
 Not if you get up and exercise! Hut, two. Hut, two. Yes, sir. my buns are nice and toasty.
 You're welcome, Squidward.
 Yeah! Your yard is really fun! There are kids playing on it right now!
 Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet!
 Ah, perfect.
 Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet.
 Hi there!
 How's it going?
 Lalalalalalalalala! Whee!  Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff.
 Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts!
 Got to hurry, Gary.  The sooner I get to bed, the sooner I'll get to sleep, and the sooner I get to sleep, the sooner I'll wake up, and the sooner I wake up, ooh ho-ho!  The sooner I get to go to work at the best job in the whole wide world: The Krusty Krab!  Now, to just put on these sleepy time blinders, before I run excitedly to bed.  Well, good night, Gary.
 I'm just going to turn out the lights.  Clickety poo. And close my eyes and go to sleep.  Just close my eyes and go to sleep.  ...just close my...  Maybe if I run around it'll tire me out.  Oh, I just got to get some sleep! There's only one thing for this.  Ah, that's the stuff. A glass of warm snail milk.  Dah! Why isn't it working--  Whoa, Gary, what happened?  Agh, I'm late for work!  Oh, my gosh, only twenty seconds to go! What the...?  Bridge out?  Hopscotch!  Almost there.  No! I'm late. What's Mr. Krabs going to say?
 Order up!  Here you go, sir. One Krabby Patty, Krabby Fries, and Krabby Drink in three seconds flat.
 ♪Mr. Sun came up, and he smiled at me. Said, "It's gonna be a good one just wait and see." Jumped out of bed and I ran outside feeling so extra ecstatified. It's the best day ever!♪
 Hey, Gary.
 Why is this the best day ever you ask? Because, Gary, I get to start this wonderful day bringing life to a whole new generation of delicious Krabby Patties, followed by a vigorous mid-day session of karate with Sandy, and an afternoon jellyfishing with Patrick, where I'll unveil my newest, most prized possession: the Deluxe Jelly Slayer Composite Pro! And for the grand finale, every one of my closest friends joining together for Squidward's clarinet recital. I am so excited I think I'm gonna explode!  ♪It's the best day ever♪
 ♪It's the best day ever♪
 ♪It's the best day ever♪
 ♪It's the best day ever♪
 I'm ready!  I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?
 No, Patrick!
 Patrick, I needed those.
 57 times.
 I'm a winner?
  I'm a winner.
  I'm a winner.
 I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner!
 I didn't get a license, Patrick.
 No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all.
 Let's just go home, Patrick.
  No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive.
 No, Patrick. No!
 I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?
 I'm here for you, buddy.
 You got a perfect score?
 Perfect score.
  Like a winner.
 Huh?
 I'm so happy for you...  Whoa!
 Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.
 Two millionth?
 Yeah, just like you.
 Can we go home now?  We've been driving around your house for hours.
 Thanks for the ride, Patrick.
 Patrick, what are you doing?
 4:00?  Who could be at the door at this hou—  Now what is it, Patrick?
 You got your license.
 You got a new boat.
  Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep.
 Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat.  I'm so tired.
 Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work.
 Thanks for the ride.
 That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...
 When did we get a drive-thru?
 I used to have a dream.
  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I—
 What's with the helmet, Patrick?
 Uh-huh.
 Oh?
  Oh, that would be great.
 Patrick!
 Mom!
 Hey.
 Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.
  40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car.
 Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?
 Are you sure you don't want to run him in?  It's a red light, Patrick!  Patrick, you just ran three red lights!
 You're suppose to stop!
  Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!
 I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!
 If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!
 Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this!
 Patrick, what do you think you're doing?
 What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait!  Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.
 Patrick!
 I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever.  Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy.
 What?
 Oh, then what do we do with this?
 Yeah!
 Ready, pal.  Woo! Woo!
  Come on, stovie, pop that corn!  Get ready, Gary.  Incoming!
 Popcorn is served!
  I want to impress and amaze my friends!
  Here it is: Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit.  Look at all this! A book of spells, my very own wand of whimsy, the beard of Rasputin, and, of course, the all-important license to practice magic.  Squidward! He'll appreciate my newly delivered skill.
 Well, let the rotting continue, friend, while I impress and amaze you with...magic!
  Silly Squidward. I won't learn vanishing spells until I become a level 10 wizard.  No, I better start with something simpler.  Say card conjuring.  Here, hold this simple, playing card while I transform it into a magic playing card before your very eyes. Let's see...  step 1...
 Which brings us to... step three. Juggle something. Well, if you insist, Mister Magic.
 Then take one card and shove it in your ear.
 You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets.  Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter, a two fisted Jumper, and a gold-throated stinger!
 Oh, this year's migration is gonna be a big one!
 Wow. This looks like a job for Ol' Reliable!
 Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever.
 Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloid netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world.
 Good night, Patrick.
  Ah, I love jellyfishing.  Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable.  Ol' Reliable?  It's gone!
 Oh, right. Pants.
 Patrick, Ol' Reliable has been stolen!
 Put one over there, Patrick.
 Maybe we should spread out a little.
 Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return.
 12 dollars and...  ...38 cents.
 Oh! Hello? Hello?
 Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!
 No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net.
 Hello?!
 What?! Really, Patrick?
 Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever.
  Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net.  Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday.
  No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net?
 Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present.
  It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to.
 I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.
 Sorry, Squidward, you got to go lower to win.
 We're limbo dancing to get ready for the dance-a-thon auditions.
 You built us a trophy case for when we win?  Oh, you are a true friend.
 I think we better raise the bar.
 We're up, Patrick. Wish us luck, Squidward.
  You kidder. Let's go, Patrick.
 Well, see you at the finals tomorrow, Squidward.
 Yep.
 You're just not getting into the spirit of this thing, Squidward.
 How'd the audition go, Squidward?
 Impressive.  Hey, Squidward, would you be our coach for the finals?
 Yes, yes I am.
  Ready!
  How'd you know?
  I guess they're happy.
 Gee, Squidward, with your arms and legs doing all the work, I'm not really doing anything. I think I should help.
 Well, I just...
 You know what, Squidward?
 I think I'm suffering for my art now.  Good gravy. Get a load of the talent here.
 Morning, Squidward. I waited for you to stop sleeping like you asked. So, you got any plans for the day, Squidward?  Okay, Squidward, I'll catch ya later.  Hi, Squidward, wanna play?
 Okay, Squidward, see ya later.
 Hey, Squidward, wanna play?  Okay, Squidward, see ya later.
 Hey, Squidward, wanna play?  Okay, Squidward, see ya later.  Hi, Squidward, wanna play hide-and-seek?
 How 'bout a game of hangman?
 How about Duck, Duck, Hermit Krab? Hopscotch? Squidward Says? Steal the Bacon? Sleeping Sea Lions? Sharks & Minnows? Sink the Submarine? Kings & Queens? Mahjong?  Whoa, I've never played this game before. What's it called?
 Something tells me Squidward doesn't wanna play today. That's it. If I can't play with the real Squidward...  I'll just make one of my own!
 Just say hello to him, Squidward. You know how sensitive he is.
 Uhh, Squidward, he prefers to be addressed by his full name.
 How does he do it? Right again, Squiddy. You little charades master, you.
 Actually, Patrick, this is...
 Good one, Mini Squid! You are always such a ray of sunshine. Are you ready for another fabulous day of work at the Krusty Krab?
 Order up, Mini Squid!
 Here you go, pal!  Go get em', tiger!
 Well, ol' Mini Squidward, I guess this is it. We've had some good times playing charades and dancing around like two giddy butterflies!  Remember?
 But I guess it's time for you to move on, huh? Onto greener pastures. Arrivederci, mon frere.
  Bye-bye! What's the matter, actual-size Squidward?
 Yeah, I have something even better!  Another me!
 Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?
 Time off?
 Aye aye, Mr. Krabs.
  I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation.  Hey, Gary.
 That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary.  Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward.
 What's a vacation?
  No work?! But what'll I do all day?
 But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.
 Replacement?
 I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique.
 I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work.  My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside!
 I'm not here to see you, Squidward.
 I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick for lunch.
 You have my word, sir. No working.  Hey, Pat, it's time for your lunch...  Patrick, you can't do that!
 You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit.  Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty.
 Wait, it's not what you think.
 But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.
 Yes, Mr. Krabs.
 Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset.
 Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up.
  Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up.
 Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming...
 You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house.
 Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally.  Hey, that reminds me of...  Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax.  That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds.  That one's a jellyfish!  That's a pirate ship.  And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup?  Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here.
 Patrick, shhh.
 Somebody help, I'm stuck!  Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here.  Um, Mr. Krabs?  Noooo!!  Uh oh.
 Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs.
 Just take the next right.  Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off.
 My house is back that way, Mr. K.
 Where'd you say you were taking me?
 It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a...   That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them!
  Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire like that? Like trash? I don't think so!
  I've been waiting for you, Patrick!
 Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television.
  Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!
 You must've saved a fortune.
 Wow! That's more than I make in a year.
  Yippee! I happily acquiesce.
 You can't rush perfection.
  Always the kidder, Squidward.
 A wishing well, here? Wow!
 Yeah, Squidward, don't you believe in magic?
 Well, I do. This well's gonna make a lot of dreams come true.  What's the first thing you're gonna wish for?
 Squidward, aren't you excited? This is really gonna help people. ♪Take a penny and some magic, even though your life is tragic...♪
 ♪...you can throw all your dreams down the well. Although everyday the pain grows you ride unicorns on rainbows, if you throw all your dreams down the well.

 ♪When you throw all your dreams down the well.♪  Well, Squidward, what do you think?
 You mean magic, don't ya?
 And I've got a date with a Krabby Patty.
 A promotion?  Why do I have to go down in the well?
 How long do I have to stay down here?
 Thanks for the promotion. It sure is dark and scary down here.
 Our very first wish! I can't wait till it comes...
 Gosh...  Ow!
 Hey!
 Patrick!
 Patrick, this is a wishing well. Just throw in a coin and make a wish.
 Patrick.
 Patrick, you're supposed to let go of the coin when you throw it.
 Well, we've got 6½ hours ‘til the end of my shift. What do you want to do now?
  Tag, you're it.
  Tag, you're it.
  Tag, you're it.
  Tag, you're it.
 I did great, Mr Krabs. I got a nickel from Sandy, 2 pennies from Mrs. Puff, a penny from Plankton...  ...and this slightly used pair of dentures.
 This wishing well was a wonderful idea, Mr. Krabs. Has anyone's wish come true, yet?
 Really?
 Can we come out now?
 Aww, no one's wishes are coming true. What did we do wrong? I know I believe hard enough. Maybe I just didn't dig deep enough. What do you say, Patrick? Are you ready to dig for some magic?
 ♪Oh, the magic has gone missin' and everyone's still wishin' but their dreams have fallen flat upon the ground. You'll find magic under rubble so, Patrick, grab a shovel and here is where the magic can be found. We're at the bottom of a well but man won't it be swell, when we make everyone's wishes all come true.♪  Holy mackerel, look, Patrick! We've struck magic.
 Next to being a fry cook, it's the most important thing I've ever done.
 Do you wanna make a wish?
 Guess what, Squidward? We found the magic.
 No, it's true! We did find the magic. Oh, I wish you could see it.  Squidward! You decided to join the party.
 We were just gonna play some party games.
  Tag, you're it.
 Maybe if you had more upper arm strength.
 It means he's afraid of Santa Claus.
 Stop it, Patrick, you're scaring him!
 Umm, Squidward, you're standing on my foot.
 Hey, hey, hey, guys.
  You shouldn't fight in here. This is a magical place.
 Bye, Squidward. Enjoy your trip!
 We didn't get any money. But we found something better. We found the magic.
 We dug down deeper in the well and found the magic. Now all the wishes will come true!
 That's great, Sandy!
 It's beautiful, Mrs. Puff. How's about letting me take it for a spin?
 See, Mr. Krabs? She wished for that boat.
 Is that proof enough for ya?
 Mr. Krabs! No!
  Did you say a monster Krabby Patty?!
  All right, Gary, ready for your yearly shell waxing?
 Just look at that shine! Now let's check under the hood.  Geez, Gary, this place is a real snail-sty.
 Still? From New Year's Eve?  What?! I've been looking everywhere for this, Gary.  My favorite novelty t-shirt!  Oh, someone's here.
 Special delivery? Just for me? You think I'm...special?
 What could it be today, Gary?
  A videotape?  "You're a winner -- SpongeBob SquarePants". I'm SpongeBob SquarePants!
 King of Karate?
 Ooh... Did you hear that, Gary? I'm going to be crowned...  King of Karate!  Whoo-hoo!
 Hello, Sandy. Have you heard the news? I've been invited to Karate Island to be crowned the king of karate.
 Oh, sure, Sandy, all the big karate experts go there.
 Maybe your karate  the best, but now they've recognized a new number one.
 All right, Sandy, you can come with me to witness my crowning moment.  Are we there yet?
 What make you think that's Karate Island?
 Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived.
 Oh, thank you.
 Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. Mr. Udon isn't interested in a karate novice like you. He only has time for royalty.
 You hear that, Sandy? He called me "master." Bring on your best fighters! I'll try to go easy on 'em.
 Pa-shaw! Watch and learn, sister.  Yup. That's how the King of Karate does it. Who's next?
 The one and only.
 I'm ready to be King of Karate!
 My throne.
  Come, Sandy, take your place next to the king and share in my crowning achievement.  Bring a seat for my air-breathing friend.
 Oh, do I detect a note of jealousy, Sandy?
  But who's being crowned King of Karate - not you.
 Sandy's going to miss out, big time.
 No!
  Sandy, I need you! I can't handle this myself.
 No, Sandy!
 You mean I'm not King of Karate?
 Don't do it, Sandy!
 Sandy, I'm sorry I acted like a jerk back there. Thanks for saving me from...  buying a condo.
 I still have one question, though. Does this mean I'm not King of Karate anymore?
 The Flying Dutchman!  What are you doing in my house?
 Squidward! Squidward!  Squidward! Help!
 Squidward, you have to help me! There's a gh-gh-gh,
 PATRICK! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!  Patrick, you gotta help me! The Flying Dutch...  ...man.  Gary!  Don't you dare hurt my little Gary!
  Gary!
 It's okay, Gary.
 Goodnight, Gary.
 Um, Dutchie? Is this gonna be much longer?
 Well, you've been here a while, and, uhh, I've seen all your tricks.
 Eeeh.
 Oh, no, no. I meant that I'm just used to it, that's all.
 You just gotta scare someone other than me.
 Just what kinda talk is that? You're just off your game, that's all.
 Sure, relax a little.
  Hey, champ! How's it...
 What is going on around here?
 Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! Everyone, get out!
 Dutchie! Do you wanna spend eternity on this couch?
 Look in the mirror. You're a ghost of your former self!
 Yes, you are. But we're going to raise you up from your squalled conditions through the use of visual aids. Watch now.
 A journey into self-awareness.
 Now get off of that couch and into your clothes, Dutchman! It's time to get serious.  Let's start you off easy. You think you can take that old lady down there?
 Now that's the Flying Dutchman I know. Let's see you put those words into action.
  Now he's got him.
 Wait a minute! I think you gave me the answer to all your problems!  ...goblins...guilt trip...
  Dutchie, it worked! You got your scare back!
 And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon.
 Good Ol' Dutchie!
 Wait for it...
 Ahh, isn't it great working at the Krusty Krab, Squidward? Huh? Isn't it? Working here?
 Yeah.
 Aww, yeah.
 Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest.  Litter.  Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper?  Kids these days.  I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now.  Where is all this litter coming from?!  Not on my watch.  Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter.
 Yes.
 Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there saved room for his just desserts.  Yeah, just desserts.
 Who?
 Who?
 He seems kind of angry with us, eh, Squidward?  Squidward? Squidward?
 Hi, officers. So, he's going to jail, right?
 Yeah, Strangler.
 Hey, that looks like me!
 You nice officers will protect me, right?
 Those officers are right. I need a bodyguard!  Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard.
 This would be him, Mr. Krabs.
  Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard.
 You don't understand, mister. I need protection from the scariest guy in town. Here's his picture.
 I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty.
 Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next?
 Or that pebble.  Or that stick.  Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium!
 Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?
 We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!
 Yes, excellent.  Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands.
 Quick is my middle name!  Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard?
 I'll take both!
 Hmmm.
 I'm not sure if these are my pants.  How about this one, bodyguard? Too overbearing?
 Here we are. SquarePants Manor! Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have.
 Protect me?
 Don't mention it, Strangler.  I mean, bodyguard. Now where'd I put my key?
 Well, I can't find 'em. You wanna take a look?
 Sure! With these spiky cleats, anything is possible!  Ya!
 I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas!
 Don't be mad, bodyguard. Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside.  There you are, you little rascal. Now, to put the key in the lock, which should activate the tumblers, thus opening the door.  Step inside...
 Well, here we are!
 I know, isn't it great?  Ooh.
 A surprise party to celebrate my perfect on-time percentage at work?  Oh, how'd you guys know?
 Bye, everybody, thanks for coming! Bye Mr. Krabs, bye Plankton, bye Sandy, bye Larry, bye Pearl, bye Mrs. Puff, bye Squidward, bye, eh, the rest.  Ahh, alone at last.
 Just you, me, and the floorboards.  Yeah.
 How did you guys know today is my birthday?
 Thanks for coming!  Alone again.
 Uh-huh.
 Oh yeah.
 Wait! We can trust Patrick. He's my best friend.
 So, Patrick's the Strangler. Gee, you think you know a guy.
 He's not?
 Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream?
  Wait, bodyguard, I need protection!
 I'm not safe! Come back!
  Good idea, bodyguard. He'll never find us up here.  Good thinking, bodyguard. The Strangler could have been on that plane.  Bodyguard, bodyguard!
  The Strangler!
  Easy...  Perfection!
 Just a second, Squidward. Well, Krabby Patty, it's time for you to go now.  You grew up so fast, I...  Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't do this.  Just take it Squidward, take it away.
  That's me!  Mmm. My compliments to the chef!  Hello, what's this?
  Mr. Krabs?
  What's a hidey-hole?
 What's in this thing? Treasure?
 Why'd you dig up your navy chest, sir?
 Wow, look at all your cool navy stuff! What's that?
 Neat.
 How'd you win that?
 Wow! Oh-oh. Who are those guys?
 Did you have a cool nickname, Mr. Krabs?
 You were?
 Well, I guess you were thinner back then.
 You want me to punch you in the stomach?
  wow, my entire arm disintegrated.
 Aye, aye, sir!  Alright, let's get this place ship shape. You men, stop laying around!  To battle stations.  All hands on deck!  Set course for full flavor.  Ketchup and mustard off the port bow.  One Krabby Patty ready to set sail.
  Mr. Krabs.  Hello? Mr. Krabs?  You alright? Are you sleepy?  Mr. Krabs!  I don't smell his pulse.  What's that?  Is somebody there?
  You're alive! And naked...
 What's molted?
 Wow.
 Barnacles!
 Sorry about the foul language, Mr. Krabs, but you're acting like there never was a man in that shell. The Krabs of his navy days was fearless. He wouldn't let something as insignificant as a missing shell slow him down.
 Who cares how silly, pink & fleshy you look. How non-threatening, limp & soft you are. How...  ...oops.
 Wow, it sure is dark in here.  Look, Mr. Krabs, I'm you!
 Well, I'm glad you got my point. It's not what's about on the outside. It's what's on the in...
 I get to be a navy buddy?
 Oh, that'll be a snap. Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years.
  Look at me, I'm Mr Krabs. I love money.
 I once won a marathon because someone dropped a penny at the finish line.
 Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story.  Goodnight, wallety.
 Oh, what's that you say? Me daughter, Pearl, needs an operation? I'll do it me self and save a nickel.
  Patrick, I'm scared!
 We are camping.
 Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us?
 Okay. Have fun inside.
 Just... have fun inside! See you tomorrow.
 What?
 What?
 But all I...
 Okay. Have fun inside!
  Squidward's gonna come camping with us!
 That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside?
  Customization!
  Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had.
 Well, time to punch that clock. But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar.  You are a winner.  And today's the first day of summer!  Happy first day of summer, Squidward!  Care to join me for solstice caroling?  Walking in the grass, it's so fine, don't need shoes in the summertime!
  Yeah.
  Gee, Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever!  What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?
 The money?
 Oh.
 Tell me more about summer break.
 I've been taught the true meaning of summer.
  Almost closing time, Mr. K.
 Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there.
 See anything, Mr. Krabs?
 The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.
 You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey!  Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment.  Huh?
 Krabby Land, sir?
  Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?
 Stall 'em? How do I do that?
  Hey, kids!
 No, I'm not. I'm, uh...  I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!
 Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles?
 Well, you've never seen my bubbles.  Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?
  Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins.  Ta-da!  Uh... huh.
 Okay, uh... and now for a finale!  Oops.
  My eyes!  Whoa!   They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery.  Hey, kids, check this out.
 I got 'em right where I want 'em.
  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
 Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.
 The kids are using them as... boomerangs.
 What are we gonna do?
  Really? He's here?  Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
  Listen, everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!
 Who do you want?
 When do you want him?
 I'll say you have.
 Closing time.  The saddest time of the day!  Huh?  It's a Krabby Patty.  Eww... It's cold and hard.  This could have rolled under there years ago.  There, there, little one, your journey is almost over.
 But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill.
 But it's old and cold. And so very full of mold.
 Order up, Squidward.
 Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders.
 Because it growled at me.
 Yes, Mr. Krabs?
 Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings.  He won't like it!
 Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive!  Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?
 Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'.
 Yes sir.  Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility...
 Aye, aye, sir.
 Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs.
 Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning.
 Wait just a burger-flipping second!
 Good morning, pineapple!  Good morning, Gary!
  Good morning, world! I'm ready! World?
 Squidward's last name is Tentacles?
  Fancy. So that's what came in the mail. Looks like Gary has a new little playmate.
 Training?
 Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day!
 Boy, you got that right. Gary's no...  hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race?
 You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine.
 Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
 Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail!  Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies!  I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use.
 Kelp powder for muscle mass.  Raw eggs, 'cause they're cliché.  And nails for toughness.
 Of course, I expect you to eat this.  It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary?  Wow, pretty good time.
 Patrick, your snail is a rock.
 Boy, the competition's getting tough.  That's it, Gary.  We are going to start some serious training right now.
  Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints.  On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary!  Gary?  Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win.
 Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do.
 Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious.  Come on, Gary, move it!  Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down!  Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go!  Come on, push it, Gary, push it!  Move that shell!  Come on, Gary, move it!  Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster!  Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it...  Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke.  Come on, Gary, we're gonna be late for the big race!
 Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape for the rest of his life.
 No, Patrick, that's the official.
 Alright, Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it.
 What!
 What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it!
 Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now!  Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary!  Go, go, go, go, go!
 Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster!
 Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?!
 Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster!  Huh?
 Uhh, Gary?
  Umm, Gary, you can stop now!
 You can take a break now if you want to, Gary.
 No!  Hold on, Gary, I'm coming!
  Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!
 You did?  Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!
 You did?  Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary!
 Gary?  Oh!
 Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?
  Psst, try the coral bits.
 What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
 Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.
 Wow, a trip!
  Time for Boating School! Let er rip, Gary.  Ahh...  Ta-da! Not bad, partner in crime. The toast could have been a little darker, though.  See you later.
 Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today.
 I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone?
 Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me?
 You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it!
 Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime.
 Behold, Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning.  And this is the Fountain Of Learning.  And these are the Lockers Of Learning.
 No, they're just the stairs.  These are the Stairs Of Learning.
 I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'till 9:00.
 Late for being early.
  And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom.
  And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge.
  And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board.
  Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too.  There you are.
 Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem!  74.
 I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project.
 The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat.  This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes, Roger would die.
 Patrick!
 The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair?
 This is gonna be great!
 You, Patrick, she's the teacher.
 I guess it's just in the timing.
 Hey, Patrick.
 I thought of something funnier than 24.
  25.
 Yes, Mrs. Puff.
  Big Fat Meanie? Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!
 No...
  I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!
  No!   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
 What, me? But why?
  Thanks a lot, Patrick.
 Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here.  It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway?  'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?
  Just ignore him, SpongeBob.
 Whatever you do, don't look at him.
  What?
  HI?!
  There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!
 Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one!
 It is after class!
 They're talking about us! We're fighting!
 Detention!?
  In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg.  It's all Stupid Patrick's fault.  I hate you, Patrick.
 I'd hate you no matter what.
  I'd hate you even if that made sense.
 I'd hate you, even if, uhh...  Um, I'd hate you...  even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out.  Huh?
  Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty.
 I respect you, Barnacle Man!
 Evil?
 Holy oil spill! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch enemies: Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble!
  Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself?
 You can't give up. What if we help you?
 Okay!
 I do!
 Wow! The Mermalair!
 Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were the most heroic heroes ever! And you had the best lunch box, too.
 Want to see me run to that mountain and back?  Want to see me do it again?
 Holy halibut! It's the chief!
 Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef!
  Make that two!
 Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off!  Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off!
 Get it off! Get it off!  Whew...I'm glad that's over!
  Gary, the paper's here!  You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section!  I am a happy sponge!
 Oh, hey, Patrick.  Well, I'd better get going.
 I didn't say anything, either.
  Alright, quit messing with me, I know you said something.
 It's a baby scallop.
 No, Patrick! It's totally helpless.  It looks like he can't even fly yet.
 No, Patrick, he's just a baby.  He's all alone with no one to take care of him.
 You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple.  Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in.  There you go. It's the best seat  in the house.
  Is it true? Are you hungry?
 I've got just the thing.  How would you like a Krabby Patty?
 Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty.
 Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before.
  French fries?
  All we have left is this apple.
 Of course, scallops love worms.
 Well, you should be good for the rest of the...
 I don't know! Aww, don't cry.
 Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah, look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, look at the funny face!  Look at the funny face!
 How did you know?
 Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.
 You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves.
 I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.
 Hey, Squidward, check this out.  Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become...
  Heave-ho!
 But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad.
 Patrick?
 Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on.  Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?
 Patrick, we're not getting paid at all.
 Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff.
 First, we need to set up the tarp.
 We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick.  Now that's what I'm talking about. Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now.
 And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off.
  Patrick, the lid's already off.
 I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick!
 Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready.  Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush.  All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go.
  Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall.
  I'm getting to the painting.
  No problem. Here I go.  Yeah! Huh?!  Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?!
 Noooooo!  Patrick?
 I don't think this bubble can get much bigger!
 Pat, no!  We did it!  We painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the--  Flappin' Flotsam! What's that?!  We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?
 That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!
 Okay,  this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off.  There! I think I got it.
 This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar…
 But Mr. Krabs said…
 Did it work?
 Did it work?
 Did it work?
  Nothing's working!
 It didn't work.
 Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet.
 Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick, no!  No…why'd you put it in the...  Grab it, Pat, grab it! Hurry, hurry!  Aww, Pat, no, no!  Get it, Pat, get it, get it, get it!  Oh, no-ho-oh!
 Okay, okay, we still have time!  Don't panic, SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome!
  Hurry, Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea!
  We're all done, sir. Everything looks great.
 Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going...
  Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me!
  It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!
 Hi, Mr. Krabs.
 Oh, you know, just hanging around.
  No, No, Mr Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!
 We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!
 You mean our butts?
  Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!
 Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on.
 What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out.  What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary?  Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear?
 Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right?
 Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep.  Robot! Oh my gosh!  Huh?
 I surrender! Oh.
 Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose?
 #17 --  Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh?
  There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you?
 Well, keep your eyes peeled.  They're everywhere. Back to work!
 That sounds like Mr. Krabs.
 That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels "recharged."  If I didn't know better, I'd say he was...  ...a robot! Nah.
 Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's...  ...a robot? Nah.  Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot!
 I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too.
 Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs!
 Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it.
 Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward?
  Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's...  ...a robot!
 Hey, Mr. Krabs!
 Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad?
 Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either.
 That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love.
 Hey, Mr. Krabs!
 I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you!
  Squidward?
 Mr. Krabs!
 Mr...
 Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries.
  Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy!
 Squidward, the robots are running the Navy!
 I don't know!  Hey, a nickel!
 Sorry.
 Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot.
 Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information.
 I can't take it!
 Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch!
 Oh, yeah.
 Right.
 Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear?
 Where's Mr. Krabs?
 This is one stubborn robot.
 I got an idea.  Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robot tricks.  If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will.
 Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his "little buddy."
 I guess it didn't know anything.
  This is the last robot, Squidward.
 I also said they couldn't love.
 Uh, at least he's not laughing.
 The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their...  imagination.  Hey, it's time to feed Gary.
  One, two, three. One, two, three.
  "The Krusty Krab Employee Manual; 2nd Revised Edition; Page 35; Section 19; Clause 3a, states: All staff must remain on the premises until the day's receipts are fully accounted for".
  "Clause 3b: The provider reserves the right to be unfair".
  No.  Whew.
 Squidward, you're making a big mistake!
 But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy. And what could be better than serving up smiles?
 I never knew you felt so strongly about it.
 Well, I guess I can't stop you. But Squidward, it's a cold, cold world out there. No one's going to serve you happiness on a silver platter.
 Cookies!
 Anyways, I just want you to know, if you ever get in trouble, come find me. I'll take care of you. 'Cause you and me...  ...we're like brothers, only closer.
 Or a football playing king in space...with a mustache.
 Squidward? Squidward, is that you?
 It's me, SpongeBob.  We used to work together.
 There ya go. So, where you living these days?
 Great. And what have you been doing with yourself? No, wait, let me guess...Hmmm...I see you've been working on that mustache, the tattered clothes, the awful smell...you're a football player?
 A spaceman?
 A football playing king in space--
  Even your paintings?
 There, there. You can come live with me.  Here you go, Squidward. You can sleep in my bed.
  Nonsense. You stay as long as you need to.  Good night, my little angel.  Breakfast is ready! You're gonna need to build up your strength again so I laid out a big buffet for you.
 Ahh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Here comes the plane.
 It's no trouble. Is there anything else I can do for you, winner?
 Oh, wow. Nurturing a broken spirit sure is a lot of work. I'm bushed. Still, it feels nice to do good.  Good night, Gary.
 Good night.
 Here you go.
 Good night.
  Gary! Squidward is not a freeloader and he would never take advantage of me.
 He's just having a hard time getting his confidence back.
 I'm sure he's close to a breakthrough.
 Ah, yes. How foolish of me.  Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit.  And I won't do anything else.
  Oh, I'll be changing, alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah!  Hi-yah!  Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah!
 Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready!  Ready to get it on.  Hi...
  Great minds think alike, I suppose.
 I may be down, but I'm not out!
  Hi-yah! Sandy?
 Oh, I get it. She's "Sandy." That's her name; she's also covered in... yes!
 Ew.
 Yeah, let's go in.
 Wow.
 How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup?
 It's on!  If I could just run this under some hot water...
 Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes.
 Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong in Weenie Hut Jr's?
 Super Weenie Hut Jr's?
  What weenies. Oh, brother.
 What? But I'm not a weenie!
 That's impossible!
  I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie!
 So, your name's Reg?
 Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will!
 Hey, everybody, what's goin' on?
 I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order.  So, uh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate?
 Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap.
 Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch.
  I am not a weenie!
 My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's.
 Patrick, what're you doing here?
 I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only way of getting into the Salty Spitoon!
 I've got no choice.
 Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it!
 Afternoon, Reg.
 Well, that makes me pretty mad.
 Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury.
 Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny.
  I, uh...  don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy!
 Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners!
 I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby!
 Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember?
 I did?
 Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life!  Sandy?  What happened?
 I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos.
 Weenie Hut General?
  Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? Must... get... autograph!
  Autograph!
 Can I have your autograph, can I have your autograph, can I... they're gone.  Mermaid Man's belt!
 Hey, guys! Wait up!  I've got something for you...
 You forgot your belt! You forgot—  Mermaid Man's secret utility belt. The emblem of submersible justice! For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations... and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands. Well, I guess I should return it.  Or not.  I could just hang onto it till after work... all alone with Mermaid Man's belt. I wonder what this button does.  Whoa.  The small ray.
  There you go. Come again, sir.
  I don't know.
 Nothing.
 Nothing.
 No, no!
 Yes.
 Me, uh... either.
 Please don't tell!
 Please don't tell!
 Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure! Please don't tell!
 Don't!
 No!
  Do-o-o-n't!
  I'm begging you!
 I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it!
 Uh... uh, okay, uh...
 Uh...  Uh...
 Uhh, I can do it!
  No! I can't let you do that! But there must be someone else who can help! Someone smart and wise, with years of life experience.  Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!
 Patrick, I was at work, and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look.
 No, Patrick!
 Patrick!
 Patrick, no! That's not an action figure! That's the real Squidward! I shrunk him by accident.
  Wait, you don't understand! This is serious! I don't know how to unshrink him! He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life.
 You think so?
 Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing!
 What?
 Patrick, I don't think Wumbo is a real word.
 Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you.
 Oh no!
 Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too!
  No! He can never find out! But I'll think of something. I promise.  Until then, you'll be safe in this jar.
 It's only two people no big deal, nobody else saw it.
  Sandy!
 I'm sorry, Sandy! Mermaid Man came in and...
  Whoo! I'm gonna have to get a bigger jar.
 Oh, Squidward, he'll be so disappointed.
 You don't understand!
 Mom?
 Mermaid Man? I'm so sorry, it's just that I'm such a big fan, and your belt, and...
 I've got it!  Ta-da!  Since I couldn't make you big, I made the city small!  And now, only one more thing to shrink. Cheese!
 See anything yet, Patrick?
 That's me!
 Thank you!
 Thirty more seconds, Patrick.
 Easy... easy...
  Pretty smart, huh?
 Squidward, we don't need a television. Not as long as we have our...  ...imagination!
 With...  ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate!  Arrrrr! A football player!  Hup!
 Sure, Squidward.
 Okay, Squidward, but if you change your mind, we'll be in this box!
 Let's go for it!  Gloves!
 Hats!
 Underwear!
 Okay, Patrick, climb up there and secure this rope.
 Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, you're going too high!
 Take it easy, Patrick, you've got to acclimate!
 Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! I think we should keep our voices down! We might start an avalanche!
 I said, I think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches!
 Our voices!
 Hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way!
 No, Patrick, I can't do that!
 Because I already cut off my own arms!
 But, Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry.  The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe.
 What can I get for you...handsome?
  Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up!  He wants one of everything.
 Try the Krusty Kelp Dog, sir!
 The Powdered Driftwood is exquisite.
 More Diet Red Tide?
 And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal?
  He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!
 Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor.
 Duped!
 We've been smeckledorfed!
 I bet he bites whale bubbles.
 It doesn't seem right...  ...but it feels so good!  Seahorse radish: the gnarliest stuff in the ocean.
 Oops, I dropped it in the toilet!
 I call it the 'Nasty Patty'.
  Here you go, sir, enjoy.
 Phew, that's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it.
 Why, sir?
 Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?
 But you told me to give it to him!
 You're right, Mr. Krabs, I'm guilty. I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me.
  Eww, gross, germs, it's all icky and corpse-y!  Eww...eww...
 Yes, sir.
 There's a big rock in the way!
  Aye aye, sir!
 What do you mean, Mr. Krabs?
  Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought he might need some air.
 Shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf?
  What a brave man, going in the line of duty like that. Why...why...why?!
 Mr. Krabs, I'm too young to go to jail!
 Can I lose my cool now?
 Oh, Neptune! Get away!  Ooh...ahh-ahh...  A-hem... Okay! All set back here. Nothing unusual about a muddy shovel in the trunk.
 Ahh...
 I understand, Mr. Krabs, but what do you want me to do with the bo...
 Oh, man, this is so gross!  The back door is locked! What am I gonna do?!
 Well, the back door was locked, so I came around here...eh.  So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go put my hat in the freezer now.
 The dark deed you requested is done, sir.
 What? You can't pin this whole rap on me!
 It was all Mr. Krabs' idea.
 He wears curlers to bed!
  It's the zombie!
 Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!
  Good one, Squidward.
 Like you don't know.  Saying,  "I hate Krabby Patties."  That's hilarious! Everyone loves Krabby Patties.
  You're good at that.  Hey, everyone! Squid says he doesn't like Krabby Patties. Ha!
  Sorry, Squidward, it's just so funny. You know what we say.
 What?
  What? What did you say?
 I'm sorry... I don't...
 Those words. Is it possible to use them in a sentence together like that?
  Never had a Krabby Patty?! Well, you've got to have one right now!  No wonder you're always so miserable! Here, try this.
 If you try it, you'll love it!
  Sorry, Patrick.  Come on, you're gonna—
 Open up the tunnel, here comes the train. Choo-choo...
  Whoop! What's that in your ear?
 Come on, open wide!
 But it's good for you!
 No, Squidward, I meant... good for your .
 Okay, just half.
 A quarter?
 One bite?
 Just smell it.
 Come on, Squidward.
 One bite.
 You won't be sorry.
 It's delicious...
 Ahhhhh...  Eeeeee.... Oooooh-oooooh-oooh...
 But—
 But, it doesn't make any sense. The Krabby Patty is an absolute good.  is immune to its tasty charms.
 Are you sure?
 No.
 I didn't think it was possible, but, I guess some people just don't like Krabby Patties.
 Yes, Squidward?
 Coming right up!  Listen, Squidward. I want to apologize for before. I was only trying to make you happy.  But I guess deep down inside, I was trying to make myself happy, but now I've learned there's room for all kinds of people in this crazy old  ...and they all don't have to like the same things.
 ...And while I strongly disagree with your decision, I accept it.  You know, it's not often I get to make one like this. I want to see the look on their face when they take that first bite.  Triple Krabby Supreme! Triple Krabby Supreme! Did somebody order a Triple Krabby Supreme? Huh, they must've left.
 Noooope, a patty this special should be eaten fresh, and... well... I haven't had one of these babies in over twenty minutes, so...  Well, whoever they were, they had great taste!  Ahh, they don't know what they're missing. Well, back to work!
 Oh no, what's this doing here?! This patty should be cremated!  I know you didn't like him, but... it means so much that you came.
 Squidward?  Is that you?
 I always come to work at 3:00 A.M. This is when I count the sesame seeds.  What are you doing here?
 And why is the patty vault open?
 And why are you holding a patty behind your back?
 And why are you acting so nervous? And why are you sweating so much? And why do you look so hungry? And...
 You like Krabby Patties, don't you, Squidward?
 I knew it all along, Squidward. No one can resist a Krabby Patty!  Squidward! How many are you eating? Squidward!  Squidward, you can't eat all those patties at one time! Squidward!
 No, worse, it'll go right to your thighs...!
 ...and then you'll blow up!
 What a beautiful day.
 Can you believe that sun?
 Uhh, Patrick?
 Nothing.
 I don't know. Let me check.  Looking good. How's yours?
 Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard.
 What a guy. Is it any wonder he's so popular? Just imagine... if I were a lifeguard.  That would be so cool.
 Who needs to be a lifeguard? I'm cool.  I'm every bit as cool as Larry. And if I'm not, let me be struck by...  ...a flying ice cream truck.  And live!
 Lifeguard?
  White stuff. You think I'm a lifeguard?
 You really think so?
 (high voice) I'd love it!
 Hi.
 It works.  Woohoo! That was the greatest, Larry.
 By myself?
 I'm not just ready.  I'm ready, Freddie.
 Action?
  I'd better call the doctor, 'cause I've got spring fever! Good morning, little flowers.  Hello, Squidward, isn't it a lovely day?
 Have you said hello to the flowers yet?
 Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever. I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers.  You're on your way. I bet you're thirsty.  Huh?  I'm not taking my eyes off you.
  Two soups, please. Thank you.  You keep the change.  What?  I saw it! It was big! It was all wiggly! And it ate everything!
 It was an Alaskan... Bull... Worm!
  What? But, Sandy, you don't know what you're up against. We're talking about an Alaskan... Bull... Worm!
 But, Sandy, you don't know!
  Sandy! Sandy!
 Wait! Sandy!
 Sandy, don't go!
 Sandy, I saw it! It's big... scary... and pink!
 You'll get massacred!
 Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail?
  Um, I do?
 Um... in my pocket.
  No, it's not. This is your tail.
  How would you know?! It's always behind you! Oh, don't go, don't go, don't go!
 Oh, yeah? What if I said... 'blargen-fezibble-nukhip'?
  You know, tails are so overrated. Let's just forget about it and go home.  I've got ice cream! With nuts...  Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm! Y'all come back here, young lady!
  Sandy, if you want to get to that worm, you're gonna have to go through me!  Sandy, no! I can't let you! I'm not gonna let you get killed. If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure!
  No, not tough enough. Not tough enough!
 You are.
  You did.
  You do.
 Okay.
 There isn't anything...
  Ain't nothin'  too big or too ornery for you to catch. But...  But...  And...  We...  I...  Yeah but...
 You see...
 I...
 Sandy, are you sure you...?
 Sandy, that's not...!
 Sandy, that's not...!
 Sandy!
  Sandy...?
 That's not the worm.
 That's not the worm. That's his tongue.
 So what's the plan, Sandy?
 I could've thought of that. Hey, wait a minute! I was right, wasn't I?!
 Ah, he is too big for you, isn't he?
 I wanna hear you say it!
 Say it!
 Say it, or I'll trip you!
 Say it!
 Say it!
  I knew it.
 Uh, Sandy?
 What do we do now?
 I'm way ahead of you, Sandy.  Look, it's a necklace! S for "SpongeBob" or S for "Sandy"! That way they can identify our bodies.
 Yay! He'll never get out of there!
 Yay! Let's go tell everybody!
 Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?
  This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?
 You are the teacher? To my pupil? This isn't art class, it's Heaven.
 I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles.
 Yes, please.
 I have no talent.
 Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
 If I'm lucky,  Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art.
 How's this, Squidward?
 Well, first I draw this head.  Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy.
 Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try.  Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog. That's you on the bottom.
 I call it: Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped of paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time.
 I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen.
  How's this Squidward?
 Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons.  I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence.  I don't even deserve to use your doors!
 But I did deserve that.  I deserved that, too.  And I deserve this!
 Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness.
 Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame.  These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy. I can't look at them.
 Really?
 Really?
 Really?
 Wow.  Really?
  Squidward, look. It's ol' Bold and Brash!
 I... can't!
 I did it, Squidward.
 I don't know, Squidward. That stuff's not in the book.
 That's not in the book, either.
 Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it.  Ta-da!
 First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept.
 I've gotta embrace the marble!
 I've gotta sniff the marble!
 I've gotta lick the marble!
  I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble!  I've gotta be the marble! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within.
 With this tool, I shall give birth to art.
 But, one more thing.  There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in.  It looks like the excitement of my artistic triumph is too much for Squidward. Oh, well, back to the dump.   ♪To the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. To the dump, to the dump, To the dump, dump dump. ♪
  Did you hear that? We get an assignment!
  Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight?
 Yeah, I know!
 Wow! Now we never have to stop working!
 Isn't this great, Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working!  It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease!  Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!
 Good! 'Cause we've got customers!
 Psst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen  at night!
  Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm chopping lettuce...at night.  Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night.  I burned my hand!...at night.  Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, na-na-na-na-night! Night!
 All right!  Taking out the trash. Taking out the trash...at night.  You mean outside?
 I don't know, Squidward,  it's kinda dark out there.
 You're right!  For the Krusty Krab!  Piece of cake!
 Pfft, nah.
  What? What do I know?
 Tell me! Tell me!
  What happened, what happened, what happened!?
 The Slash-Bringing Hasher?
 The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa.
  Tell me the story!
 He forgot the secret sauce?
 He didn't wash his hands?
 Irregular portions?
 You mean like this?  Or like this?  Or this?  Or this?  But what about this? Or this, or this, or this, or...
  So?
  Oh, no!
 Tuesday.
  But tonight's Tuesday night!
 How will we know?
 No.
 What?
 What?
 What?
 It's not?
 Ohhhhh.
  Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing?
 Here's your net.  Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves.
 Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box!
 It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets.
 I've got a gazillion secrets!
 Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly.
 You wanna hear one of my secrets?
 Uhh... Let's see...  Did you know that you're my best friend?
 Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naïve.
 Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think Jelly-Fishing and Bubble-Blowing are the…  ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word "fancy" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear, right now.
 Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?
 Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uh…  I've got my secret socks on.  And my secret Gary's bowl!  My secret TV!  And my secret TV channel.  What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?
 But, Patrick, I must know the secret!
 Come on, Patrick, just a peek?
 But... we're supposed to be...  friends forever.  I feel so filthy!  I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself!  I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!
 So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?
 What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish!  Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds.  Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victims' severed heads in a box.  Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party!  I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do!  That's it! How do you look in a secret box?  Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back.  Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary?
 Oh, what do you know? You're a snail!
  I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up.
  Shhh!
 Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper.
 Uh…
 Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop!  It's me, SpongeBob!
 No, really, Patrick! Look!
 If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside.
  Really?
 Okay! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes!  Huh?
 It's just a string.
 Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that!  Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow!
 I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along!  Wait 'till I tell Gary!
 Okay. Ready, Patrick? One...
 Look, Mr. Krabs. I'm doing it, I'm doing it!
 Why, yes. Yes I am.
  The Krabby Patty formula is the sole property of the Krusty Krab and is only to be discussed in part or in whole with its creator, Mr. Krabs. Duplication of this formula is punishable by law. Restrictions apply, results may vary.
 SpongeBob.
 Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, as long as these pants are square,  and this sponge is Bob,  I will not let you down!
 Code twelve, code twelve!  Your disguises can't fool me this time, Plankton!
 Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was just trying to protect the secret formula.
 No free napkins?
 Only discuss the formula with Mr. Krabs.
 Hi, Mr. Krabs.
 No sign of Plankton, yet. Gosh, Mr. Krabs. You don't look so good.  Ooh, you're so cold.
 I got it, I got it. I got it, I got it
  Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happened to your metal pants?
 You gave him the day off.
 Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir!  Hey, Mr. Krabs, just taking out that garbage.
 Whoa-ho, Mr. Krabs. I didn't know you had heat vision.
 But I thought you wanted to ask me a question.
  I don't know, Mr. Krabs... I don't know.
 Mr. Krabs...  Wha...
 Scrub-a-dub-dub, I love to rub.  Hey, Mr. Krabs, just doing a little scrubbin'.
 I can see that, Mr. Krabs.
 Isn't that a microphone?
 But, sir, we haven't done the secret handshake yet.
  We don't shake with our hands, remember?
 We stand on one foot.  Balance a glass of chocolate milk on our heads and sing the Bikini Bottom National Anthem.
 Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again: bath time.  Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way,  or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way...  So that's how you wanna play it, huh?
 Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch!  Huh? "New" Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm.
  Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath!...  ...Please...  ... I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages.
  Hey everybody! It's Leif Ericcson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgin! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Ericcson Day! There's a note.
 Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me.  Another note.
 I don't get it. The water's fine.  Hey, Squidward! Want to play?
 Are you sure?
 Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy!  Nah...  Rock Buddy! Nope...  Sink Buddy! "[Sink Buddy drips a little water]" Almost...  I've got it!  Bubble Buddy!  This...is...great!  I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs.  Don't be shy, come on!
 Hi, Squidward!
 I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy!
 Oh, I'm not hungry.
 Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet!
 He's hungry.
 Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you.  Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just have one of everything.
 Bubble Buddy's thirsty.
 Sounds great!
 Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws.  Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think?
 Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties!
 Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do?
 Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch.
 Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward...
 That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs!
 Here we are, Bubble Buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here.
 See what I mean?  All done!
 Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get some cotton candy.
  My friend's in there.
  Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah!
 Hey, Pearl! Shake hands with Bubble Buddy!  It's his first time on his own.
 Hey, Bubble Buddy, you're finished!
  Hey, everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy?
 Hey, is this one of those sewing circles?
 Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable.
 Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern.
  Why?!
 No! I won't let you!  Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha haa! Never!  Never...
 No! You can't! He's not just a bubble, he's a Bubble Buddy! He's my friend and I love him! Haven't you ever had a very special friend?
 So, what do you say?
 Noo...
 So long.
 Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes!  Seems like only this morning I held his bottle.  They blow up so fast.
  Hold still, Gary.
 Almost done.
 That's great, Patrick. What's it for?
  "For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?"
 Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake.
 Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?
 Exactly!
 No, don't! That's my...  ...award closet.
  Aww, Patrick, don't cry.  You'll get an award one day.
 But you're Patrick...  Star. You can do anything you want.
 Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.
 Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?
 Smaller.
 Smaller.
  The smallest you can think of.
  Yeah!  I do things at work all the time.
 And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?
 You have to work for it, remember?
  Pick up order!
 No, you have to take the tray to the customer.
 Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table.
 Nope.
 Let's try something different.
 All you have to do is answer the phone.
 Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant.
 It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out?
 You'll do fine.
 Keep trying, Patrick.
  Kitchen!
 Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar.  Easy. Now you try. First get a jar.  Patrick, that's a pickle.
 You need a jar.  No.  No.  No. Try...this!  Now take the lid off the jar.  Just relax. Lift your hand.  Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid.  No, the lid.   Freeze!  Almost there. Now head for the lid.  Cold.  Warmer.  Warmer.  Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!
 Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do.  Exactly as I do.  Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.
 No, no, Patrick, you did it!
 That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it.
 Oh, yeah.
  Yeah.
 Patrick, you do exactly what I do and you'll have an award in no time.  I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready.
 Wow. It's amazing how a simple change of clothes can make a guy look...just...like...me.
 That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready...  Huh?
 Well, back to the ol' grind.
 Forget my hat.
  Dropped my spatula.
 Aha!  You're copying me!
 Why are you doing that?
 Well, it's annoying, so stop it!
 Say, you're good.
  At least I'm safe inside my mind.
  Stop copying me!
  Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?
 We'll see about that!
  I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.
 Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice.  Ha! Not a scratch on me.
 Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?
  I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me.  Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.
 But, Patrick...
 Another trophy?
 'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'.
 Patrick! This trophy's for you!
 So, what are you gonna do, now?
 I was just testing it.
 One Krabby Patty coming up!
 Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table nine.
 Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?
 The hooks?
  What could be worse than that?
  Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs.
 Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
 Hey, Patrick.
 I can't leave now. I'm working.
 Where is everybody?
 Doesn't look like any carnival I ever...  Excuse me.  Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous!
 All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!
 Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahh, what a beautiful day!  I wonder if Patrick's at home.
 Goin' over to Sandy's place.  Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place.
 What is it?
 Texas? What's a Texas?
 All right then. Let's make one of your treedome.
 Sandy? Hi-yah!
 Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy.  Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah!
 Uhh, Sandy?  Surf's up, Sandy!
  Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing!
 Look, Sandy, we caught one!
  We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!
 Go on, go back to where you belong.  Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them. Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind. Remember: there's no place like home!  Sandy, what the heck are you crying about?
  Sandy...
 Homesick, huh?  Almost there.
 Da-ta-dah.
  Squidward!
 Squidward! Squidward, wait!
 You dropped this little piece of paper.
 I just figured you probably want it back.
 Garbage?! But, Squidward, in the right hands, this paper is a gold mine of entertainment. A spectacular afternoon of underwater fun. A treasure trove of...
 So you don't want it?
 Does that mean I can have it?
 You sure?
 So are you definitely, positively sure?
 But are you...
 Last chance to change your mind, Squidward.
 So, I take that as a possible no? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward?  Okay, Squidward, that's a promise I'll just have to keep. Ah, Mr. Paper, I am so lucky to have a friend like Squidward.
 I'm sorry, Squidward, it's just...  ...it's just that I'm thinking of all the fun I'm going to have with this piece of paper!
 La, la, la, la, la. Gary, watch this!  Guess what I am.
 Well, yes, Gary, I am a sponge with paper stuck in his pants, but I'm also...  Super Sponge, soaking up crime. See, here's my cape.
 Now I'm...  SpongeBob JunglePants!
  Happy Valentine's Day, Bikini Bottom!
  Well, I'm bubbles for you, Sandy.
 Okay.  Step one:  Patrick and I get to the Valentine's Day carnival.  Step two: I position Patrick and myself on top of the Ferris wheel.  Step three: You arrive at designated checkpoint for maximum visual contact.  Step four: Patrick is thrilled. Mission accomplished.  Hi, Patrick.
 Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob.
 Patrick!
 Patrick...
 Patrick, I'm right behind you!
 And I have a present for you!
 It's the greatest...  ...the bestest...  ...the most fantabulous...  ...present ever!  But you can't have it yet.
 Because it's not ready yet.
 Not yet.
 Do you want to ruin the surprise?
 Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
 Hmmm...nope, sorry.
 No can do!  You'll just have to wait!
 Okay, Patrick, here we are
 It's not the carnival.
  Here, why don't you take this quarter and...
 It's not the quarter.
 Now, take that quarter and buy some cotton candy...
 Ten-four, Sandy, SpongeBob here.
 Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is.
 You'll have to guess!
 No.
 No.
  Nope.
 Are you sure?  SpongeBob to Sandy, you can bring it in now.
 Late? But what about...  ...Patrick?
  If Patrick doesn't get his valentine...
 Patrick! Uhh, actually it's on the Ferris...
 Well, this is where you're gonna get it...I hope. Just keep looking out there, pal.  SpongeBob to Sandy, SpongeBob to Sandy, come in, Sandy!
 No, no, B, Sandy! No, B!  Uh, Patrick, you know how sometimes you plan something special and things don't just work out?
 Patrick, here it is!
 It's a handshake...a friendly handshake.
 A friendly handshake. Happy Valentine's Day!
 Uh, no problem, Fran.
 You too, Dave.
  Patrick!
  Ah! It's raining Krabby Patties! Yeah!  A quick midnight snack and then it's back to bed.  Aww, sleep tight, my little angel.  Ah, here it is.  Nothing like a sea-nut butter and jellyfish jelly sandwich to get you to sleep.  The fridge!
  Oh, Gary, I don't feel like myself.
 Don't be silly, Gary. I don't get colds. I get the suds.
 No, Gary. If I had the suds, I'd have bubbles coming outta me.
 I can't get the suds,  because then I'll have to miss work!
 No, Gary. I like wearing my underwear like this.
 I'm not sick. I'm going to work.
  Right away, sir.
  Here's that patty you wanted, Mr. Krabs, sir.
 No, Mr. Krabs, I'm okay, honest.
 Oh, Gary, I feel horrible.  Oh, who am I kidding, Gary? I've got the suds, no doubt about it.  I'd better take care of this before it gets out of hand.
 Sandy, I'm sick.  Can you escort me to the doctor's?
 Yeah, okay, Sandy, thanks.  Coming.
 I'm sick, Patrick. I'm going to the doctor.
 Why not, Patrick?
  It can't be as horrible as the suds.
 Is that the horrible part, Patrick?
 No!
 No, no! No stethoscope, no doctor, no old magazines, no hiss! No!  Patrick, I don't want to go to the doctor.
 You gotta help me get better, Patrick. Please? Would you like to be my doctor, Patrick?
 I don't know.
 No bubbles! Patrick, your treatment is working!
 Sure! At this rate, I'll be cured in no time. In fact, I'm going to call Sandy and tell her not to come. Thanks, Dr. Patrick!
  My fingers are too big for the buttons.  Dr. Patrick, will you call Sandy for me?
 Uh-uh.
  Not really.
 I don't...think so.
 No.
 Nope.
 Uh-uh.
 Hiya, Sandy.
 Ahh...
 I'm okay, Sandy, really.
 I'm better, guys! Really!
 Guys!
 I can't stop now!  Help me!
 Mr. Krabs!
  You're not going to make me read old magazines, are you?
 Whoo! Yeah! Whoo!  This tickles!  I can smell again!  Whoo! Yeah! Yeah-eah! Whoo! Yeah!  I feel as good as new! I love the doctor!
 Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!
 Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.
  There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: "The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt".
 Take a break and play around with us.
 I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!
  I already took care of it.
 My turn.  One, two, three, four.  Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way.  Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.
  Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs.
  You are a real pirate. Go straight to the "X" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs!
 Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.
 I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.
 I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.  See you tomorrow.  Huh? Who's there?
  Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs.
 Mr. Krabs, you gotta...
 But, Mr. Krabs...
 But, Mr...
 But, Mr...
   Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?
 Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.
 Pirates?
 Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches.
  Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate!
 Ow.
 Really? Can we see the map?
 Okie dokie, then.
 Okie... oops.  I mean...  arrgh! Captain Krabs.  Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh...
 The whole ship is underwater captain.
 But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has...  Which way, captain?
 Mr. Krabs, we're tired.
  Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew.
 I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.
 But we've only been gone a few hours.
 I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!
 He's not here.
 Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.
 Patrick, what are you doing?
 Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map.
 No, guess there isn't.  Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself.
 Yeah?
 You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?
 Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!
  Look! It's the "X".
 Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map.
 We got it, Captain Krabs.
 What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?
 We found it together. So we deserve a share!
 What about loyalty?
 And one for all.
 And one for all.
 And one for all.
 And one for all.
 Wow!
 Ah, time for bed, Gary.
 Oh, Gary.  You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary.  Hey! Over here!  Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license!  Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it!  I sure take a good picture.  Darn! I should have grown a mustache.  How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt.  Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here.  Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!
 No!  Ouch! Where am I?  Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
  This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look.  Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is.  Gary! Huh?  Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...?
 Gary?
 Gary! You can talk!
 What does that mean?
 Who?
  Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.
 Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now.
  I wonder what Patrick's dreaming.  I can't resist!  Hey, Patrick!
  You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
 I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper.  Going up! Eh?  I can make...  A million of me! Eh? Eh?
 Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream.
 Ooh, this is gonna be good!  Psst! Squidward!  Hey, Squidward!
  Squidward!  Huh? Huh?
 Trust me, Squidward.
  La la! La la la la la la la!
 Good morning, Squidward! Wanna go jellyfishing?  Great! We'll be right over!
 Ready to go?
 No, Patrick, he's just not ready.  Ready now?
 How about now?
 Now?
 Now?
 How about now?
 Now?
 Now?
 Now?
 Now?
 Ready yet?
 Sure we do.
 Ready?
 I'd love to be at work today! But it's Sunday; the Krusty Krab is closed.
 Well, he's not here. I'll bet that eager-beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields!
 Huh? Who's there?
 Okay, Mr. Krabs, the dishes are done, I'm leaving!
 No thank you, Mr. Krabs. Uhh, does it have monsters in it?
 Uhh... no.  Is it a true story?
 Okay, maybe just a little.
 Excuse me, did his ship look like a Krabby Patty?
 Do souls look like pickles?
 Humph, Squidward!
 The name's SquarePants. It's SquarePants!  I don't get it, Gary. Every Halloween, no matter how hard I try, everybody scares me.
  Well, I'm sick of it.  No more ScaredyPants!
 Gary, it's Patrick! I'm going to scare him! It's my turn.  Rawr!
 Why can't I be frightening for once? Where's my chance?
 What do you think?
 No, no! I'm the ghost of the Flying Dutchman!
 I don't know, Patrick.
  Rawr-rawr!
 Okay, okay, here's your candy.
 I don't get it, Patrick.
 That is it, Patrick!
 What's the difference between that ghost and me?
 I have a square head and a real ghost has a round one. All we have to do is make my head round and boo, I'm scary!
  Remember, like this.
 Shave me down, make me round!
 What do you think?
 Oooh... I'm the Flying Dutchman!
 Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman!
 Do you think?
 Who should we scare next?
 Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman!
  Exercise time is over, Gary.  We don't want you getting too thin.  Here, boy. Fetch!
 Huh?   Good job, Gary!  I love you, Gary!  Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary!  Ha, ha! Down, boy! Ha ha!
 For what?
 That was this weekend?  I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!
 Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
 Do you know what today is?
  No, silly!  That's on the 15th!  Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month.
 What do you mean?
 That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too, if you tried harder.
 Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile.
 Huh?
 Nooo!  How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?!
 Making...Krabby Patties?
  Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!
 That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...
 No, Squidward!
 An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.
 What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?!
 But, sir…
 Crystal, sir!
 I won't let Squidward win!  He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited.
 You can't win that award if you don't get up for work!
  That can be arranged.
 Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row.
 I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow.
 Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!
 Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!
 Well, me neither! …26-time loser!  Look at him. Watchin' me.
 Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh?
 Nope!  Nighty Night.
 Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?
 All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work!
 Now to get some rest. Don't want to look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo!  Squidward!
 Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty!  Ow! Squidward!
 Truce.
 You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it.
 And may the better man win.  He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!
  As soon as he stops shaking my hand...
 Hike, Patrick, hike!  You just lost three points.  One. Two. Five!  G-7!
 But it's not Tuesday, Patrick.
 Now what?
  Okay... ready!
 I got it! I got it!  I got it! I got it! I got it!  Remember, Patrick, finders keepers.
 Uhh, Patrick? I think something's wrong with Squidward. He looks unconscious.
 Get off him, Patrick!
 But he still feels cold.
 Do you think he'll be okay?
 I don't know.
 No, no, that part goes here.
 We're almost there. We can do this.
 This is working.  Patrick, this isn't working!
 I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's... He's... He's pushing up daisies!
 Nccording to docs.python.org/2/tutorial/… – furins Jan 22 '15 at 9:40o, stay back!
 It was an accident!
 Please, Mr. Squidward's ghost!  Spare us your ghostly anger!
 We'll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us!
 Does that include...
 Here?
 Here?
 Here?
 Too tired...
 Only the freshest, o spooky one.  A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness.  A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness.
 Art thou not pleased?
 Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it.
 Flank steak.
 But this is just a piece of tissue paper.
 I can't do it!
 Patrick, are you ready for this?
 Okay, let's go. Patrick, are you coming?
 Patrick, it's this way.
 Here.
 It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off!
 Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman.  It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?
 No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest.
 Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony.
 We're going to put you to rest.
 Yeah.
 Okay, get in.
 But you said we could put you to rest.
 A-ha!  Hey!  Okay, that's far enough! Huh?  Tartar sauce!
 Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and...  Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true.
 Plankton! It's you!
 Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.
 I said, you're a--
 Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy!  Wow!
 What is it?
  Wow, what are you gonna do with it?
 The moon! Can I go?
 But I don't take up that much space!  See?  I can fit in here.  Mmm, cozy.
 Well, how about...  This?  Or this?  Or this?
 Fine.  Put me in the brig, I don't mind!
 Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?
  Yeah! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride! Moon ride! Moon ride!
 Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?
 Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting.
 Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores?  And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night?  Ah! There's one now!
  Oh, hurry up!  These oughta do the trick.
 What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here?
 A present?
 There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy.
 Alien repellent? Let me see that.  New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows!
 It's pretty impressive, all right.
 We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!
 We don't, we're just spraying the...  ...windows.
 Yeah, just don't touch anything.
 Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun...  ...house?
 Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?
 Patrick, I don't think we should...
 No more!  Okay, one more.  Okay, that's enough. Let's go.
 Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here and I happen to know that that particular button is right over here.
 Look!  We're in space now! Wee!
 Hey! You got your toothpaste in my peanut butter!  Patrick, I can do this!
 We must be landing.
 Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick.
 Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it!  Yeah!
 Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me!  Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier!
 Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them! Uh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee, Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to.  Make sure your gun is pumped.  Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting.  It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis.
 Patrick, do you know what this thing is?
 No, it's an egg sack! Let's look at the embryo.
 Let's capture the little phony!
 We don't want your money, moon man!  Look at them squirming around in there.
 Well, there's plenty more where those came from.
 There's no time for that! Just push harder.
 Nice try, Sandy.
 It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone.  So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!
 Yeah? Well, I got you now.
 Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face when she sees this!  Sandy, I'm back!  Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different.  Uh-oh...
 Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!
 I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First, I have to make my speech.
 Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.
 And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties...  ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall!  Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time.  "Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears."  In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform  and assume my duties as...  ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff!  Oh, and I will be re...
 I overdid the speech again, didn't I?
 Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this.  I hardly knew ya.
 Yes, Mrs. Puff?
 A-hoo!  Thanks, Mrs. Puff!
 Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor!  What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?
 On patrol. I'm on patrol.  Uh-oh, an open window.
 The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example.  I'm the open window maniac!  I hope you learned a valuable lesson!  On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol...  Vandals! Another crime.  hmm...strawberry! I must act!  Patrick...  Patrick... Patrick...
 Patrick! Down here!
 Patrick. Come down here.
 I'm down here.
 That's hall monitor to you!
 Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in.
  "Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
 Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority.  Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?
 Okay, now what?
 This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies!  And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run ‘em out!
  Oh, uhh, Mr. Krabs, can I get my paycheck?
 Uhh, sir, I can't see you. The boots  are in  the way.
 Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots.
 Who's that?
 ♪I'm ready! I'm ready! I want those boots!♪
 Hmmm.. I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck?
 And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?
 And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders!
 And...
 One cryin' Johnny comin' up! First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up!
  Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up!
 I got it already, Squidward.  Bubble Bass.
  Yep. I hear talk you're kinda picky.
 Well then... here ya go!  Well, Bubble Bass, whaddaya think?
 No!
  But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on!  Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles?
 Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty.
 Wait! Wait! Wait!
 Okay, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let's see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then pickles? No! That's not right!  Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the pickles? No!  Mustard down, bun stuff down, d'oh, where's the patty go?  Pickles, ketchup, wait! Think! Think! I'm losin' it!  Bun down, shoe, mustard, pan, bun... no!  Mr. Krabs, I am so confused. I can't remember how to do anything.
 Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?
 Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup...  The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing!  Oh.  Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better go on home and rest my brain.  Uhh, which way do I live?  Of course.  No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomatoes, pickles, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No. Shoe?  I am so confused! Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get my head on straight.
 Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or...  D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow.  Good night, Gary.
 Aw, this isn't right.  Good night, Gary.
 Wait, this isn't right either.  Nope.  Nuh-uh.  Negative.  C'mon, c'mon! Get it right.  Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet!  Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!
 Gary!
  Come on, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot.
 Safety first.  A-ha! I finally gotcha!  Ah, there is nothing better than the taste of natural jelly from a jellyfish. See you later!  Oh, oh my glasses! Thanks, little guy! Bye!  I can't play anymore, jellyfish. I got to get home.  No. You can't go home with me.  Jellyfish, you've got to stay here! Hey!  Stay!  Stay...  [exasperated] Jellyfish! For the last time, you cannot come home with me!  Ahh, what the heck!  Squidward! Hey, Squidward! Squidward! Squidwardiard!  Squidward! Look at my new pet!
 No he isn't! Watch this! Fetch!  How many fingers am I holding up?  Play dead!
 Well, we're going to my house to have a little fun.
  Whew! Wow, you sure like to dance. Well, that's enough for tonight. It's time to go to bed.  Huh?  You got it all wrong, little fella.  Bed. Repeat after me.  Bed!  We'll just keep you right here.
 Quit worrying, Gary. He'll be just fine. Good night, everybody.
 Good morning, Gary. Good morning, jellyfish. Jellyfish? Jellyfish? Here, jellyfish. Oh, jelly!
  Oh, jellyfi-!  Where'd you all come from?  Okay, that's it. Party is over! You guys have overstayed your welcome.  This music is way too loud.  Very funny.  I'm serious!
 Come on, guys, enough is enough!  Uh-oh! Hey, take it easy! Ow! Okay, I'll talk to him!  Squidward! Would it be possible to play your clarinet a little... better? I don't think the jellyfish like it.
 Okay, he said he'll play better.  Uh-oh! That's not better!  Hey! Take it easy with that!  Those are my things!  Don't break th- Dow!
 Hey, now, that wasn't nice!  Okay, that is it! Everybody out!  Come on, Gary!  Gary, you were right. Thanks for not rubbing it in.  Huh? They stopped?  Gary! Don't... stop... shaking it!
 Hooray, Gary! We're finally huge!
 Huh? Wait a minute! Oh no!
 Shellphone! I know, I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do!
 Squidward!
  Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking and I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and smaller...  Oh no!
 Ohh... nematodes.  The only thing left of my house is this little pebble.
 I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone! It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live?
 I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad.
 We can't build a house!
 Alright, Patrick, lets get to work!
 Yeah! So what do you think?
 Really?
 One bedroom.
  Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop.
 That'd be great!
 Good night, rockmate.
 Good night, Gary.  Oh...what the...?
 No, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick! Wake up! Wake up! It's me, SpongeBob!
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
  Squidward? Squidward?
 Squidward?
 Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?
 Thanks. Thanks, Squidward.  Squidward, could you scoot over a little?
 While you're at it, could you get me a glass of water?
 Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here.  Thanks, buddy.
 Yeah, I like sleepovers.
 Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward.
 Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you.
 Here come my parents.
 Hi, Mom.
 Just give me a minute.  I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble.  You hold too many memories.  Well, Squidward, this is goodbye.
 Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom.ccording to docs.python.org/2/tutorial/… – furins Jan 22 '15 at 9:40
 My house is back!  Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be!  Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever!
  Wow, four stingers.  Where have I seen this before? Field Guide Here it is.  Land squirrel.  That little squirrel is in trouble.
 Hooray, land squirrel!  Look out!  Hold on, little squirrel!  You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai!  Hey, I'm actually doing it.  Your shell is mine!
  Ahh, what a wonderful day. The sun is out, the water is shimmering, scallops are chirping. So peaceful.
 Oh, sure thing, Squidward.
 Okay.
 Hey, Squidward. Wanna blow some bubbles? Only 25 cents.
 Uh huh.
 Good morning to you, sir. Would you care to blow a bubble?
 Only a quarter.
 Sure thing, Patrick.
 Thank you.
 One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go.  Could I interest you in some lessons? Only 25 cents.
 Okay, Patrick, it's all in the technique.  First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then...
 And now... with two hands!
 Excuse me, sir, but we are clo-

 No.
