# SpongePoem
Our project generates a Sponge Bob Themed Poem utilizing an LSTM recurrent neural network that attempts to guess the next character, given an initial sequence to build off of, through a GUI. The user has the option to translate the poem into English, French, German or Spanish. We used Scrapy to write a WebCrawler for the SpongeBob SquarePants Wiki page, Tensorflow/Keras for the recurrent Neural Network and PyQt to generate the GUI.
